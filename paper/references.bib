  abstract = {Publication bias is a type of systematic error when synthesizing
  evidence that cannot represent the underlying truth. Clinical studies with
  favorable results are more likely published and thus exaggerate the
  synthesized evidence in meta-analyses. The trim-and-fill method is a popular
  tool to detect and adjust for publication bias. Simulation studies have been
  performed to assess this method, but they may not fully represent realistic
  settings about publication bias. Based on real-world meta-analyses, this
  article provides practical guidelines and recommendations for using the
  trim-and-fill method. We used a worked illustrative example to demonstrate the
  idea of the trim-and-fill method, and we reviewed three estimators (R0, L0,
  and Q0) for imputing missing studies. A resampling method was proposed to
  calculate P values for all 3 estimators. We also summarized available
  meta-analysis software programs for implementing the trim-and-fill method.
  Moreover, we applied the method to 29,932 meta-analyses from the Cochrane
  Database of Systematic Reviews, and empirically evaluated its overall
  performance. We carefully explored potential issues occurred in our analysis.
  The estimators L0 and Q0 detected at least one missing study in more
  meta-analyses than R0, while Q0 often imputed more missing studies than L0.
  After adding imputed missing studies, the significance of heterogeneity and
  overall effect sizes changed in many meta-analyses. All estimators generally
  converged fast. However, L0 and Q0 failed to converge in a few meta-analyses
  that contained studies with identical effect sizes. Also, P values produced by
  different estimators could yield different conclusions of publication bias
  significance. Outliers and the pre-specified direction of missing studies
  could have influential impact on the trim-and-fill results. Meta-analysts are
  recommended to perform the trim-and-fill method with great caution when using
  meta-analysis software programs. Some default settings (e.g., the choice of
  estimators and the direction of missing studies) in the programs may not be
  optimal for a certain meta-analysis; they should be determined on a
  case-by-case basis. Sensitivity analyses are encouraged to examine effects of
  different estimators and outlying studies. Also, the trim-and-fill estimator
  should be routinely reported in meta-analyses, because the results depend
  highly on it.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rank correlation test introduced by Begg and
  Mazumdar is extensively used in meta-analysis to test for publication bias in
  clinical and epidemiological studies. It is based on correlating the
  standardized treatment effect with the variance of the treatment effect using
  Kendall's tau as the measure of association. To our knowledge, the operational
  characteristics regarding the significance level of the test have not,
  however, been fully assessed. METHODS: We propose an alternative rank
  correlation test to improve the error rates of the original Begg and Mazumdar
  test. This test is based on the simulated distribution of the estimated
  measure of association, conditional on sampling variances. Furthermore,
  Spearman's rho is suggested as an alternative rank correlation coefficient.
  The attained level and power of the tests are studied by simulations of
  meta-analyses assuming the fixed effects model. RESULTS: The significance
  levels of the original Begg and Mazumdar test often deviate considerably from
  the nominal level, the null hypothesis being rejected too infrequently. It is
  proven mathematically that the assumptions for using the rank correlation test
  are not strictly satisfied. The pairs of variables fail to be independent, and
  there is a correlation between the standardized effect sizes and sampling
  variances under the null hypothesis of no publication bias. In the
  meta-analysis setting, the adverse consequences of a false negative test are
  more profound than the disadvantages of a false positive test. Our alternative
  test improves the error rates in fixed effects meta-analysis. Its significance
  level equals the nominal value, and the Type II error rate is reduced. In
  small data sets Spearman's rho should be preferred to Kendall's tau as the
  measure of association. CONCLUSIONS: As the attained significance levels of
  the test introduced by Begg and Mazumdar often deviate greatly from the
  nominal level, modified rank correlation tests, improving the error rates,
  should be preferred when testing for publication bias assuming fixed effects
  meta-analysis.},

  publication bias. Asymmetry in a funnel plot of study size against treatment
  effect is often used to identify such bias. We compare the performance of
  three simple methods of testing for bias: the rank correlation method; a
  simple linear regression of the standardized estimate of treatment effect on
  the precision of the estimate; and a regression of the treatment effect on
  sample size. The tests are applied to simulated meta-analyses in the presence
  and absence of publication bias. Both one-sided and two-sided censoring of
  studies based on statistical significance was used. The results indicate that
  none of the tests performs consistently well. Test performance varied with the
  magnitude of the true treatment effect, distribution of study size and whether
  a one- or two-tailed significance test was employed. Overall, the power of the
  tests was low when the number of studies per meta-analysis was close to that
  often observed in practice. Tests that showed the highest power also had type
  I error rates higher than the nominal level. Based on the empirical type I
  error rates, a regression of treatment effect on sample size, weighted by the
  inverse of the variance of the logit of the pooled proportion (using the
  marginal total) is the preferred method.},

  has brought further attention to the problem that the published literature -
  which predominantly forms the evidence basis of research syntheses - may not
  be representative of all research that has been conducted on a particular
  topic. More specifically, concerns have been raised for a long time that
  statistically significant findings are overrepresented in the published
  literature, a phenomenon usually referred to as publication bias, which in
  turn can lead to biased conclusions. Various methods have been proposed in the
  meta-analytic literature for detecting the presence of publication bias,
  estimating its potential impact, and correcting for it. So-called selection
  models are among the most sophisticated methods for this purpose, as they
  attempt to directly model the selection process. If a particular selection
  model is an adequate approximation for the underlying selection process, then
  the model provides estimates of the parameters of interest (e.g., the average
  true effect and the amount of heterogeneity in the true effects) that are
  'corrected' for this selection process (i.e., they are estimates of the
  parameters in the population of studies before any selection has taken place).
  In this talk, I will briefly describe a variety of models for this purpose and
  illustrate their application with the metafor package in R.},

  Unlike standard procedures that require equating the score function of the

  the score is instead used as an external informative constraint to the
  maximization of the convex Shannon's entropy function. The problem involves
  the reparameterization of the score parameters as expected values of discrete
  probability distributions where probabilities need to be estimated. This leads
  to a simpler situation where parameters are searched in smaller (hyper)
  simplex space. We assessed our proposal by means of empirical case studies and
  a simulation study, the latter involving the most critical case of logistic
  regression under data separation. The results suggested that the maximum
  entropy reformulation of the score problem solves the likelihood equation
  problem. Similarly, when maximum likelihood estimation is difficult, as is the
  case of logistic regression under separation, the maximum entropy proposal
  achieved results (numerically) comparable to those obtained by the Firth's
  bias-corrected approach. Overall, these first findings reveal that a maximum
  entropy solution can be considered as an alternative technique to solve the
  likelihood equation.},

  abstract = {AbstractStatistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason
  is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some
  threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased
  reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be
  expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single
  studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from
  replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random
  variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as
  failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A
  general perception of a ?replication crisis? may thus reflect failure to
  recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless
  assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because
  of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical
  inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local
  descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as
  providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means
  we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and
  uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could
  help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be
  large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is
  simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results.
  Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should
  thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems
  occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why,
  and what output those methods produced.},

  have shown high-fidelity storage capacity for many properties of visual
  stimuli. On judgments of the spatial frequency of gratings, for example,
  discrimination performance does not decrease significantly, even for memory
  intervals of up to 30 s. For other properties, such as stimulus orientation
  and contrast, however, such “perfect storage” behavior is not found, although
  the reasons for this difference remain unresolved. Here, we report two
  experiments in which we investigated the nature of the representation of
  stimulus contrast in VSTM using spatially complex, two-dimensional
  random-noise stimuli. We addressed whether information about contrast per se
  is retained during the memory interval by using a test stimulus with the same
  spatial structure but either the same or the opposite local contrast polarity,
  with respect to the comparison (i.e., remembered) stimulus. We found that
  discrimination thresholds got steadily worse with increasing duration of the
  memory interval. Furthermore, performance was better when the test and
  comparison stimuli had the same local contrast polarity than when they were
  contrast-reversed. Finally, when a noise mask was introduced during the memory
  interval, its disruptive effect was maximal when the spatial configuration of
  its constituent elements was uncorrelated with those of the comparison and
  test stimuli. These results suggest that VSTM for contrast is closely tied to
  the spatial configuration of stimuli and is not transformed into a more
  abstract representation. © 2014, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {"This book provides an overview of the theory and application of
  linearand nonlinear mixed-effects models in the analysis of grouped data,such
  as longitudinal data, repeated measures, and multilevel data. A unified
  model-building strategy for both linear and nonlinear models is presented and
  applied to the analysis of over 20 real datasets froma wide variety of areas,
  including pharmacokinetics, agriculture, and manufacturing. A strong emphasis
  is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various phases of the
  model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the data and
  concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a fitted model.
  Over 170 figures are included in the book. The NLME library for analyzing
  mixed-effects models in S and S-PLUS, developed by the authors, provides the
  underlying software for implementing the methods presented in the text, being
  described and illustrated in detail throughout the book. The balanced mix of
  real data examples, modeling software, and theory makes this book a useful
  reference for practitioners using mixed-effects models in their data analyses.
  It can also be used as a text for a one-semester graduate-level applied course
  in mixed-effects models. Researchers in statistical computing will also find
  this book appealing for its presentation of novel andefficient computational
  methods for fitting linear and nonlinearmixed-effects models.},

  Fearful or happy facial expressions were presented dynamically or statically

  (Experiment 2) ms. Nonsense target ideographs were then presented, and
  participants reported their preference for them. The results consistently

  results indicate that dynamic presentations of emotional facial expressions
  induce more evident unconscious emotional processing.},

  highly limited-but flexible-resource model. More resource can be allocated to
  prioritized items but, crucially, at a cost of reduced recall precision for
  other stored items. Expectations may modulate resource distribution, for
  example, through neural oscillations in the alpha band increasing inhibition
  of irrelevant cortical regions. Our understanding of the neural architecture
  of WM is also undergoing radical revision. Whereas the prefrontal cortex has
  previously dominated research endeavors, other cortical regions, such as early
  visual areas, are now considered to make an essential contribution, for
  example holding one or more items in a privileged state or "focus of
  attention" within WM. By contrast, the striatum is increasingly viewed as
  crucial in determining why and how items are gated into memory, while the
  hippocampus, it has controversially been argued, might be critical in the
  formation of temporally resilient conjunctions across features of stored items

  particular, we combined the continuous flash suppression technique with the
  affective misattribution procedure to explore subliminal processing of

  gross and nonspecific affective reactions can therefore be diffused or
  displaced onto unrelated stimuli. At optimal exposures this pattern of results

  Reframing of the issue of dissociable forms of consciousness into dissociable

  correlate of visual consciousness appears over posterior visual cortex around
  100-200 ms after stimulus onset. Its scalp topography and time window are
  consistent with recurrent processing in the visual cortex. This
  electrophysiological correlate of visual consciousness is mostly independent
  of later ERPs reflecting selective attention and working memory functions.
  Overall, the ERP evidence supports the view that phenomenal consciousness of a
  visual stimulus emerges earlier than access consciousness, and that attention
  and awareness are served by distinct neural processes.},

  abstract = {The first decade of event-related potential (ERP) research had
  established that the most consistent correlates of the onset of visual
  consciousness are the early visual awareness negativity (VAN), a posterior
  negative component in the N2 time range, and the late positivity (LP), an
  anterior positive component in the P3 time range. Two earlier extensive
  reviews ten years ago had concluded that VAN is the earliest and most reliable
  correlate of visual phenomenal consciousness, whereas LP probably reflects
  later processes associated with reflective/access consciousness. This article
  provides an update to those earlier reviews. ERP and MEG studies that have
  appeared since 2010 and directly compared ERPs between aware and unaware
  conditions are reviewed, and important new developments in the field are
  discussed. The result corroborates VAN as the earliest and most consistent
  signature of visual phenomenal consciousness, and casts further doubt on LP as
  an ERP correlate of phenomenal consciousness.},

  abstract = {Does visual awareness correlate with early activity in visual
  cortex or with later wide-spread neural activation? This question was studied
  by presenting liminal targets in one of the four quadrants of the screen and
  asking the participants to make forced-choice localization responses and to
  rate their subjective visual awareness of each target, while
  electroencephalography was measured. In the analyses of event-related
  potential (ERP) correlates of awareness, response accuracy was kept constant
  so that only the subjectively rated awareness varied between high-awareness
  ('seen' rating) and low-awareness ('unseen' rating) targets.
  High-awareness-correct trials were associated with enhanced contralateral N200
  at 180-280 ms as compared with low-awareness-correct trials. This effect
  (visual awareness negativity, VAN) also correlated with aware sensitivity to
  the presence vs. absence of the stimulus (d'). In addition,
  high-awareness-correct trials were associated with later enhanced P3
  amplitudes (after 350 ms), but this effect correlated only with the response
  bias (c). ERPs to low-awareness-correct trials elicited larger contralateral
  N200 than ERPs to low-awareness-incorrect trials, and this effect correlated
  with conservative response bias, suggesting that it reflected weak awareness
  rather than unconscious processing. The results suggest that the enhanced N200
  correlates with graded awareness. The results support theories of visual
  awareness in which early activity in visual cortex gives rise to subjective
  visual experiences.},

  abstract = {An extensive body of research has demonstrated that anxious
  individuals abnormally process threat-related content. Yet, the manner in
  which clinical anxiety affects the selection of threatening signals and their
  maintenance within consciousness is yet to be explored. The present study used
  an emotional binocular rivalry (e-BR) procedure, in which pictures of faces
  depicting either fearful or neutral expressions competed with pictures of a
  house for conscious perception. We assumed that first- or cumulative-preferred
  perception of faces with fearful over neutral expression (i.e., initial or
  sustained threat bias, respectively) stand for preferential selection or
  maintenance of fear content in awareness, correspondingly. Unmedicated
  patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PAD) were
  compared to healthy controls for threat-related perceptual biases in the e-BR.
  At first perception of face, both SAD and PAD patients showed a greater
  initial threat bias than healthy controls. In contrast, at cumulative
  dwell-time of face, patient groups demonstrated a diminished sustained threat
  bias relative to healthy controls, yet in a different manner. SAD patients
  showed a sustained threat bias, though it was smaller than in healthy
  controls. Furthermore, increased levels of reported anxiety among SAD patients
  were associated with enhanced sustained perception of neutral faces. PAD
  patients, on the other hand, showed no sustained threat bias and a diminished
  cumulative perception of fearful faces with increased levels of anxiety
  traits. These findings indicate that anxiety disorders commonly involve an
  initially enhanced selection of threat signals into awareness, followed by
  disorder-specific manifestation of diminished preferred maintenance of threat
  in awareness. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

  abstract = {Background According to cognitive theories of depression, negative
  biases affect most cognitive processes including perception. Such depressive
  perception may result not only from biased cognitive appraisal but also from
  automatic processing biases that influence the access of sensory information
  to awareness.Method Twenty patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and
  20 healthy control participants underwent behavioural testing with a variant
  of binocular rivalry, continuous flash suppression (CFS), to investigate the
  potency of emotional visual stimuli to gain access to awareness. While a
  neutral, fearful, happy or sad emotional face was presented to one eye,
  high-contrast dynamic patterns were presented to the other eye, resulting in
  initial suppression of the face from awareness. Participants indicated the
  location of the face with a key press as soon as it became visible. The
  modulation of suppression time by emotional expression was taken as an index
  of unconscious emotion processing.Results We found a significant difference in
  the emotional modulation of suppression time between MDD patients and
  controls. This difference was due to relatively shorter suppression of sad
  faces and, to a lesser degree, to longer suppression of happy faces in MDD.
  Suppression time modulation by sad expression correlated with change in
  self-reported severity of depression after 4 weeks.Conclusions Our finding of
  preferential access to awareness for mood-congruent stimuli supports the
  notion that depressive perception may be related to altered sensory
  information processing even at automatic processing stages. Such perceptual
  biases towards mood-congruent information may reinforce depressed mood and
  contribute to negative cognitive biases. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

  abstract = {Previous binocular rivalry studies with younger adults have shown
  that emotional stimuli dominate perception over neutral stimuli. Here we
  investigated the effects of age on patterns of emotional dominance during
  binocular rivalry. Participants performed a face/house rivalry task where the
  emotion of the face (happy, angry, neutral) and orientation (upright,
  inverted) of the face and house stimuli were varied systematically. Age
  differences were found with younger adults showing a general emotionality
  effect (happy and angry faces were more dominant than neutral faces) and older
  adults showing inhibition of anger (neutral faces were more dominant than
  angry faces) and positivity effects (happy faces were more dominant than both
  angry and neutral faces). Age differences in dominance patterns were reflected
  by slower rivalry rates for both happy and angry compared to neutral
  face/house pairs in younger adults, and slower rivalry rates for happy
  compared to both angry and neutral face/house pairs in older adults.
  Importantly, these patterns of emotional dominance and slower rivalry rates
  for emotional-face/house pairs disappeared when the stimuli were inverted.
  This suggests that emotional valence, and not low-level image features, were
  responsible for the emotional bias in both age groups. Given that binocular
  rivalry has a limited role for voluntary control, the findings imply that
  anger suppression and positivity effects in older adults may extend to more
  automatic tasks. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

  abstract = {Two incompatible pictures compete for perceptual dominance when
  they are presented to one eye each. This so-called binocular rivalry results
  in an alternation of dominant and suppressed percepts. In accordance with
  current theories of emotion processing, the authors' previous research has
  suggested that emotionally arousing pictures predominate in this perceptual
  process. Three experiments were run with pictures of emotional facial
  expressions that are known to induce emotions while being well controlled in
  terms of physical characteristics. In Experiment 1, photographs of emotional
  and neutral facial expressions were presented of the same actor to minimize
  physical differences. In Experiment 2, schematic emotional expressions were
  presented to further eliminate low-level differences. In Experiment 3, a
  probe-detection task was conducted to control for possible response-biases.
  Together, these data clearly demonstrate that emotional facial expressions
  predominate over neutral expressions; they are more often the first percept
  and they are perceived for longer durations. This is not caused by physical
  stimulus properties or by response-biases. This novel approach supports that
  emotionally significant visual stimuli are preferentially perceived. © 2007

  abstract = {The human amygdala plays a crucial role in processing affective
  information conveyed by sensory stimuli. Facial expressions of fear and anger,
  which both signal potential threat to an observer, result in significant
  increases in amygdala activity, even when the faces are unattended or
  presented briefly and masked. It has been suggested that afferent signals from
  the retina travel to the amygdala via separate cortical and subcortical
  pathways, with the subcortical pathway underlying unconscious processing. Here
  we exploited the phenomenon of binocular rivalry to induce complete
  suppression of affective face stimuli presented to one eye. Twelve
  participants viewed brief, rivalrous visual displays in which a fearful,
  happy, or neutral face was presented to one eye while a house was presented
  simultaneously to the other. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
  study activation in the amygdala and extrastriate visual areas for consciously
  perceived versus suppressed face and house stimuli. Activation within the
  fusiform and parahippocampal gyri increased significantly for perceived versus
  suppressed faces and houses, respectively. Amygdala activation increased
  bilaterally in response to fearful versus neutral faces, regardless of whether
  the face was perceived consciously or suppressed because of binocular rivalry.
  Amygdala activity also increased significantly for happy versus neutral faces,
  but only when the face was suppressed. This activation pattern suggests that
  the amygdala has a limited capacity to differentiate between specific facial
  expressions when it must rely on information received via a subcortical route.
  We suggest that this limited capacity reflects a tradeoff between specificity
  and speed of processing.},

  abstract = {Abstract Affective judgments can often be influenced by emotional
  information people unconsciously perceive, but the neural mechanisms
  responsible for these effects and how they are modulated by individual
  differences in sensitivity to threat are unclear. Here we studied subliminal
  affective priming by recording brain potentials to surprise faces preceded by
  30-msec happy or fearful prime faces. Participants showed valence-consistent
  changes in affective ratings of surprise faces, although they reported no
  knowledge of prime-face expressions, nor could they discriminate between
  prime-face expressions in a forced-choice test. In conjunction with the
  priming effect on affective evaluation, larger occipital P1 potentials at
  145-175 msec were found with fearful than with happy primes, and source
  analyses implicated the bilateral extrastriate cortex in this effect. Later
  brain potentials at 300-400 msec were enhanced with happy versus fearful
  primes, which may reflect differential attentional orienting. Personality
  testing for sensitivity to threat, especially social threat, was also used to
  evaluate individual differences potentially relevant to subliminal affective
  priming. Indeed, participants with high trait anxiety demonstrated stronger
  affective priming and greater P1 differences than did those with low trait
  anxiety, and these effects were driven by fearful primes. Results thus suggest
  that unconsciously perceived affective information influences social judgments
  by altering very early perceptual analyses, and that this influence is
  accentuated to the extent that people are oversensitive to threat. In this
  way, perception may be subject to a variety of influences that govern social
  preferences in the absence of concomitant awareness of such influences.},

  abstract = {The ability to recognize one's own successful cognitive
  processing, in e.g., perceptual or memory tasks, is often referred to as
  metacognition. How should we quantitatively measure such ability? Here we
  focus on a class of measures that assess the correspondence between
  trial-by-trial accuracy and one's own confidence. In general, for healthy
  subjects endowed with metacognitive sensitivity, when one is confident, one is
  more likely to be correct. Thus, the degree of association between accuracy
  and confidence can be taken as a quantitative measure of metacognition.
  However, many studies use a statistical correlation coefficient (e.g.,
  Pearson's r) or its variant to assess this degree of association, and such
  measures are susceptible to undesirable influences from factors such as
  response biases. Here we review other measures based on signal detection
  theory and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis that are "bias
  free," and relate these quantities to the calibration and discrimination
  measures developed in the probability estimation literature. We go on to
  distinguish between the related concepts of metacognitive bias (a difference
  in subjective confidence despite basic task performance remaining constant),
  metacognitive sensitivity (how good one is at distinguishing between one's own
  correct and incorrect judgments) and metacognitive efficiency (a subject's
  level of metacognitive sensitivity given a certain level of task performance).
  Finally, we discuss how these three concepts pose interesting questions for
  the study of metacognition and conscious awareness.},

  visual short-term memory system can maintain representations of only three to
  four objects at any given moment. For over a century, the capacity of visual
  memory has been shown to vary substantially across individuals, ranging from
  1.5 to about 5 objects. Although numerous studies have recently begun to
  characterize the neural substrates of visual memory processes, a
  neurophysiological index of storage capacity limitations has not yet been
  established. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for lateralized
  activity in humans that reflects the encoding and maintenance of items in
  visual memory. The amplitude of this activity is strongly modulated by the
  number of objects being held in the memory at the time, but approaches a limit
  asymptotically for arrays that meet or exceed storage capacity. Indeed, the
  precise limit is determined by each individual's memory capacity, such that
  the activity from low-capacity individuals reaches this plateau much sooner
  than that from high-capacity individuals. Consequently, this measure provides
  a strong neurophysiological predictor of an individual's capacity, allowing
  the demonstration of a direct relationship between neural activity and memory
  capacity.},

  a combination of facial weakness with impairment of ocular abduction. It is
  questionable, whether there is a strong association of the sequence with
  autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) as suggested in some earlier case reports and
  studies. Twenty-two participants with Möbius sequence aged 6–16 years followed
  a request of the German Moebius foundation to participate in a nationwide
  study. All patients had a physical examination and intelligence testing.
  Primary caregivers were asked to complete two screening measures of ASD
  (Behaviour and Communication Questionnaire, VSK; Marburger Asperger's Syndrome
  Rating Scale, MBAS). For those who reached the cut-off for ASD and/or showed
  behavioural aspects indicative of ASDs during IQ testing and/or physical
  examination, well standardized diagnostic instruments (Autism Diagnostic
  Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and Kinder-DIPS)
  were administered. Minimal diagnostic criteria for Möbius sequence were
  congenital facial weakness (uni- or bilateral) and impairment of ocular
  abduction (uni- or bilateral). Three boys (one of them mentally retarded) out
  of 22 participants (12 males and 10 females) were found suspicious of ASD by
  screening, but none of them fulfilled diagnostic criteria of ASD on a clinical

  investigated how upright and inverted faces are forgotten within a few
  seconds, focusing on the raw errors that accompany such forgetting and

  accounted for by a larger proportion of random errors - suggesting that
  forgetting of faces reflects decreased accessibility of the memory
  representations over time. On the other hand, longer retention intervals did
  not modulate the precision of recall - suggesting that forgetting does not
  affect the precision of accessible memory representation. Thus, when upright
  and inverted faces are forgotten there is a complete failure to access them or
  a complete collapse of their memory representation. In contrast to the effect
  of retention interval (i.e., forgetting), face inversion led to larger errors
  that were mainly associated with decreased precision of recall. This effect
  was not modulated by the duration of the retention interval, and was observed
  even when memory was not required in the task. Therefore, upright faces are

  status was identified by convergent methods, including: high inter-regional
  correlations during rest and task performance, consistently higher
  correlations within the CCN than the rest of cortex, co-activation in a visual
  search task, and mutual sensitivity to decision difficulty. Regions within the
  CCN include anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplementary motor area (ACC/pSMA),
  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), inferior frontal junction (IFJ),
  anterior insular cortex (AIC), dorsal pre-motor cortex (dPMC), and posterior
  parietal cortex (PPC). We used a novel visual line search task which included
  periods when the probe stimuli were occluded but subjects had to maintain and
  update working memory in preparation for the sudden appearance of a probe
  stimulus. The six CCN regions operated as a tightly coupled network during the
  'non-occluded' portions of this task, with all regions responding to probe
  events. In contrast, the network was differentiated during occluded search.
  DLPFC, not ACC/pSMA, was involved in target memory maintenance when probes
  were absent, while both regions became active in preparation for difficult
  probes at the end of each occluded period. This approach illustrates one way

  In the second experiment, however, SL showed above-chance performance only
  when she reported a certain degree of awareness, thus showing that SL's

  abstract = {The neuropsychological phenomenon of blindsight has been taken to
  suggest that the primary visual cortex (V1) plays a unique role in visual
  awareness, and that extrastriate activation needs to be fed back to V1 in
  order for the content of that activation to be consciously perceived. The aim
  of this review is to evaluate this theoretical framework and to revisit its
  key tenets. Firstly, is blindsight truly a dissociation of awareness and
  visual detection? Secondly, is there sufficient evidence to rule out the
  possibility that the loss of awareness resulting from a V1 lesion simply
  reflects reduced extrastriate responsiveness, rather than a unique role of V1
  in conscious experience? Evaluation of these arguments and the empirical
  evidence leads to the conclusion that the loss of phenomenal awareness in
  blindsight may not be due to feedback activity in V1 being the hallmark
  awareness. On the basis of existing literature, an alternative explanation of
  blindsight is proposed. In this view, visual awareness is a “global” cognitive
  function as its hallmark is the availability of information to a large number
  of perceptual and cognitive systems; this requires inter-areal long-range
  synchronous oscillatory activity. For these oscillations to arise, a specific
  temporal profile of neuronal activity is required, which is established
  through recurrent feedback activity involving V1 and the extrastriate cortex.
  When V1 is lesioned, the loss of recurrent activity prevents inter-areal
  networks on the basis of oscillatory activity. However, as limited amount of
  input can reach extrastriate cortex and some extrastriate neuronal selectivity
  is preserved, computations involving comparison of neural firing rates within
  a cortical area remain possible. This enables “local” read-out from specific
  brain regions, allowing for the detection and discrimination of basic visual
  attributes. Thus blindsight is blind due to lack of “global” long-range
  synchrony, and it functions via “local” neural readout from extrastriate
  areas.},

  empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology
  and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and
  control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using
  standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges' d or the response ratio.
  However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the
  variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be
  informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition
  to or instead of the mean. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic
  lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of
  variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare
  differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of
  lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. Further, as an alternative
  approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log
  standard deviation) and lnx- (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed)
  model. The use of ln s with lnx- overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and
  it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation
  beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use
  of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. Our
  approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published
  meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially
  overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be
  applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has
  an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the
  application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and
  evolution.},

  environment, it is necessary to individuate them from other objects, both
  temporally and spatially. Spatially, objects can be selected from nearby
  distractors using selective attention. Temporally, object updating processes
  incorporate new information into existing representations over time. Both of
  these processes have been implicated in a type of visual masking called
  object-substitution masking (OSM). Previous studies have found that the number
  of distractors (impacting selective attention) interacts with the strength of
  OSM. However, it has been suggested that this interaction is an artifact of
  ceiling performance at low set sizes, rather than necessitating a failure of
  attention during masking. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we examined
  whether set size and masking interact as measured by markers of selective
  attention (N2pc) and visual working memory consolidation/maintenance (SPCN).
  Set size was found to affect the N2pc (200–350 ms) and late SPCN (500–650 ms),
  reflecting increased demands on selective attention and unnecessary storage
  respectively. An early window of the SPCN (350–500 ms) was affected by
  masking, suggesting that OSM influences object consolidation processes in this
  window, independent of the number of distractors. Overall, it was found that
  selective attention and visual awareness are dissociable neural processes in
  OSM, and that they are independently affected by set size and masking
  manipulations. Moreover, we found that the early SPCN may reflect disruptions
  to object consolidation, potentially revealing a neural mechanism supporting
  an object individuation-through-updating account of OSM. © 2017, The

  modeled the perceptual processes leading up to this difference in suppression

  fitted sequential sampling models (linear ballistic accumulators) to the

  explained by a decrease in threshold for visual input that matches the content
  of VWM. Converging evidence was obtained by fitting similar sequential
  sampling models (shifted Wald model) to published datasets. Finally, to
  confirm that the previously observed threshold difference reflected processes
  occurring before rather than after the stimuli were released from suppression,
  we applied the same procedure to the data of an experiment in which stimuli
  were not interocularly suppressed. Here, we found no decrease in threshold for
  stimuli that match the content of VWM.We discuss our findings in light of a

  resulting in delusions, hallucinations, and cognitive impairments. Across a
  variety of paradigms, an elevated threshold for conscious perception has been
  repeatedly observed in persons with schizophrenia. Remarkably, even subtle
  measures of subliminal processing appear to be preserved. We argue here that
  the dissociation between impaired conscious access and intact unconscious
  processing may be due to a specific disruption of top-down attentional
  amplification. This proposal is compatible with the neurophysiological
  disturbances observed in schizophrenia, including dysconnectivity, abnormal
  neural oscillations, and glutamatergic and cholinergic dysregulation.
  Therefore, placing impaired conscious access as a central feature of
  schizophrenia can help researchers develop a coherent and parsimonious
  pathophysiological framework of the disease. Patients with schizophrenia
  exhibit impairments of conscious processing and an elevated threshold for
  conscious perception, while subliminal processing is preserved. The sensory
  impairments in schizophrenia could be explained by a disorder of conscious
  top-down attentional amplification rather than by bottom-up processing
  deficits. Bayesian models account for the emergence of delusions through
  inappropriate updating of conscious representations according to sensory
  evidence. Brain-imaging and neurophysiological studies of schizophrenia reveal
  anomalies in long-distance connectivity and synchrony between distant brain
  areas that may have a pivotal role in the disruption of conscious access. NMDA
  receptors may have an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia:
  there is growing evidence that NMDA receptors are dysregulated in this
  affection, that they have a prominent role in long-distance top-down
  connectivity, and that their disruption may induce psychosis and disorders of
  consciousness in subjects without schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Electrodermal activity (EDA) is an early
  physiological index and the subject of constant interest, in spite of the bad
  reputation attached to "lie detectors". This interest is expected to increase
  in the future, following the development of research related to the
  neurobiological aspect of emotions of which it is an index. Recent data
  provided by functional cerebral imaging has added to the significance of this
  index and should result in further interest. Aim: The authors thus re-examined
  the various notions related to measuring EDA, and its practical aspect as well
  as its mechanisms. EDA should be useful both for authors wishing to use this
  variable and for readers wishing to form their own critical point of view.
  Literature findings: The article first defines the various terms used to
  qualify EDA. Then, it analyses the mechanisms occurring at the sweat glands'
  level, showing that a distinct innervation of the sweat glands causes sweat to
  be released in the excretory channels, thereby allowing the recording of a
  negative surface potential in parallel to the lowering of skin conductance.
  Arguments are then pointed out to illustrate that the potential's positive
  phase following this first answer occurs in the case of high intensity
  stimulations. The study of the central command of sudation demonstrates that,
  several areas are involved and that different functions such as thermal
  regulation and motricity may interfere with emotive reactions. Difficulties
  regarding the mode of measurement of these answers as to their number and
  amplitude are also brought to light. Discussion: A particular interest of
  measuring EDA is its ability to highlight individual characteristic and
  unconscious emotional reactivity. Subjects who constitutionally present many
  spontaneous and therefore habitual EDA can indeed be opposed to subjects whose
  EDA reflexes are very few and hardly habitual. A theory suggests that for the
  first category, whose subjects are named labiles, emotional control may be at
  the origin of EDA. This characteristic brings to mind the case of antisocial
  subjects whose rate of EDA is also reduced, although for the latter a
  primitive drop in behavioral inhibition is involved. The production of EDA in
  response to non-conscious emotive stimulations can be objectified in the rare
  cases of prosopagnosia. These subjects who are unable to recognize familiar
  faces can produce EDA when presented faces with an emotional load. These cases
  contrast with the delusional denial of the Capgras syndrome where subjects do
  not present EDA, suggesting that the dysfunction of visual analysis occurs at
  a different level. There are other rare cases represented by cortical
  blindness where EDA shows that an unconscious emotional analysis is preserved.
  These subjects are known however to be capable of unconscious visual
  discriminations, which are possibly accompanied by EDA. This possibility of a
  "blind vision" is experimentally studied via subliminal vision testing
  (backward masking tests). These demonstrate that a rudimentary visual analysis
  is carried out in the subcortical circuits while taking into account the
  affective aspect of stimulations. Conclusion: Present or future data should
  allow a greater comprehension of electrodermal signals, making it possible to
  overcome the difficulties related to their interpretation and facilitate their
  applications. © 2011 L'Encéphale, Paris.},

  determine whether non-consciously perceived (covert) facial expressions of

  insula to disgust) observed with consciously perceived (overt) stimuli. A
  backward masking paradigm was used. In the psychophysics experiment, the
  following parameters were established: 30-ms target duration for the covert
  condition, and 170-ms target duration for the overt condition. Results of the
  block-design fMRI study indicated substantial differences underlying the
  perception of fearful and disgusted facial expressions, with significant
  effects of both emotion and target duration. Findings for the overt condition
  (170 ms) confirm previous evidence of amygdala activation to fearful faces,
  and insula activation to disgusted faces, and a double dissociation between
  these two emotions. In the covert condition (30 ms), the amygdala was not
  activated to fear, nor was the insula activated to disgust. Overall, findings

  confidence, likely indicating cognitive maintenance of consciously reportable
  stimulus representations. The other pattern however was off-diagonal,
  restricted to posterior electrode sites (local), and independent of decision
  confidence, and therefore may reflect sensory maintenance of categoryspecific

  This automatic mimicry reflects underlying sensorimotor simulation that
  supports accurate emotion recognition. Why this is so is becoming more
  obvious: emotions are patterns of expressive, behavioral, physiological, and
  subjective feeling responses. Activation of one component can therefore
  automatically activate other components. When people simulate a perceived
  facial expression, they partially activate the corresponding emotional state
  in themselves, which provides a basis for inferring the underlying emotion of
  the expresser. We integrate recent evidence in favor of a role for
  sensorimotor simulation in emotion recognition. We then connect this account
  to a domain-general understanding of how sensory information from multiple
  modalities is integrated to generate perceptual predictions in the brain.
  People's recognition and understanding of others' facial expressions is
  compromised by experimental (e.g., mechanical blocking) and clinical (e.g.,
  facial paralysis and long-term pacifier use) disruptions to sensorimotor
  processing in the face.Emotion perception involves automatic activation of
  pre- and primary-motor and somatosensory cortices, and the inhibition of
  activity in sensorimotor networks reduces performance on subtle or challenging
  emotion recognition tasks.Sensorimotor simulation flexibly supports not only
  conceptual processing of facial expression but also, through cross-modal
  influences on visual processing, the building of a complete percept of the
  expression.While automatic and presumably nonconscious, sensorimotor
  simulation of facial expressions is modulated by the perceiver's social

  abstract = {Background: Emotional information is frequently processed below
  the level of consciousness, where subcortical regions of the brain are thought
  to play an important role. In the absence of conscious visual experience,
  patients with visual cortex damage discriminate the valence of emotional
  expression. Even in healthy individuals, a subliminal mechanism can be
  utilized to compensate for a functional decline in visual cognition of various
  causes such as strong sleepiness. In this study, sleep deprivation was
  simulated in healthy individuals to investigate functional alterations in the
  subliminal processing of emotional information caused by reduced conscious
  visual cognition and attention due to an increase in subjective sleepiness.
  Fourteen healthy adult men participated in a within-subject crossover study
  consisting of a 5-day session of sleep debt (SD, 4-h sleep) and a 5-day
  session of sleep control (SC, 8-h sleep). On the last day of each session,
  participants performed an emotional face-viewing task that included backward
  masking of nonconscious presentations during magnetic resonance scanning.
  Results: Finally, data from eleven participants who were unaware of
  nonconscious face presentations were analyzed. In fear contrasts, subjective
  sleepiness was significantly positively correlated with activity in the
  amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and insular cortex, and
  was significantly negatively correlated with the secondary and tertiary visual
  areas and the fusiform face area. In fear-neutral contrasts, subjective
  sleepiness was significantly positively correlated with activity of the
  bilateral amygdala. Further, changes in subjective sleepiness (the difference
  between the SC and SD sessions) were correlated with both changes in amygdala
  activity and functional connectivity between the amygdala and superior
  colliculus in response to subliminal fearful faces.Conclusion: Sleepiness
  induced functional decline in the brain areas involved in conscious visual
  cognition of facial expressions, but also enhanced subliminal emotional
  processing via superior colliculus as represented by activity in the amygdala.
  These findings suggest that an evolutionally old and auxiliary subliminal
  hazard perception system is activated as a compensatory mechanism when
  conscious visual cognition is impaired. In addition, enhancement of subliminal
  emotional processing might cause involuntary emotional instability during
  sleep debt through changes in emotional response to or emotional evaluation of
  external stimuli. © 2014 Motomura et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  recognized by the unconscious mimicking of observed facial expressions, which
  requires the implicit activation of the motor programs that produce a specific
  expression. Motor responses performed during the expression of a given emotion
  are hypothesized to be directly linked to autonomic responses associated with
  that emotional behavior. We tested this hypothesis in 9 children (Mage = 5.66)
  affected by Moebius syndrome (MBS) and 15 control children (Mage = 6.6). MBS
  is a neurological congenital disorder characterized by underdevelopment of the
  VI and VII cranial nerves, which results in paralysis of the face. Moebius
  patients' inability to produce facial expressions impairs their capacity to
  communicate emotions through the face. We therefore assessed Moebius
  children's autonomic response to emotional stimuli (video cartoons) by means
  of functional infrared thermal (fIRT) imaging. Patients showed weaker
  temperature changes compared to controls, suggesting impaired autonomic
  activity. They also showed difficulties in recognizing facial emotions from
  static illustrations. These findings reveal that the impairment of facial
  movement attenuates the intensity of emotional experience, probably through
  the diminished activation of autonomic responses associated with emotional
  stimuli. The current study is the first to investigate emotional responses in
  MBS children, providing important insights into the role of facial expressions
  in emotional processing during early development.},

  abstract = {Facial mimicry is commonly defined as the tendency to imitate-at a
  sub-threshold level-facial expressions of other individuals. Numerous studies
  support a role of facial mimicry in recognizing others' emotions. However, the
  underlying functional mechanism is unclear. A prominent hypothesis considers
  facial mimicry as based on an action-perception loop, leading to the
  prediction that facial mimicry should be observed only when processing others'
  facial expressions. Nevertheless, previous studies have also detected facial
  mimicry during observation of emotional bodily expressions. An emergent
  alternative hypothesis is that facial mimicry overtly reflects the simulation
  of an "emotion", rather than the reproduction of a specific observed motor
  pattern. In the present study, we tested whether blocking mimicry ("Bite") on
  the lower face disrupted recognition of happy expressions conveyed by either
  facial or body expressions. In Experiment 1, we tested participants' ability
  to identify happy, fearful and neutral expressions in the Bite condition and
  in two control conditions. In Experiment 2, to ensure that such a manipulation
  selectively affects emotion recognition, we tested participants' ability to
  recognize emotional expressions, as well as the actors' gender, under the Bite
  condition and a control condition. Finally, we investigated the relationship
  between dispositional empathy and emotion recognition under the condition of
  blocked mimicry. Our findings demonstrated that blocking mimicry on the lower
  face hindered recognition of happy facial and body expressions, while the
  recognition of neutral and fearful expressions was not affected by the mimicry
  manipulation. The mimicry manipulation did not affect the gender
  discrimination task. Furthermore, the impairment of happy expression
  recognition correlated with empathic traits. These results support the role of
  facial mimicry in emotion recognition and suggest that facial mimicry reflects
  a global sensorimotor simulation of others' emotions rather than a
  muscle-specific reproduction of an observed motor expression.},

  abstract = {Background: Alexithymia and emotional awareness may be considered
  overlapping constructs and both have been shown to be related to psychological
  and emotional well-being. However, it is not clear how the constructs relate
  to each other empirically or if they may overlap more or less in different
  populations. The aim of this review was therefore to conduct a meta-analysis
  of correlations between the most commonly used measures of alexithymia (i.e.,
  the self-report instrument Toronto Alexithymia Scale; TAS-20) and emotional
  awareness (i.e., the observer-rated instrument Level of Emotional Awareness
  Scale; LEAS) and to explore potential moderators of their relationship.
  Methods: Electronic databases were searched for studies published until the
  end of February 2018. Study samples were coded as medical conditions,
  psychiatric disorders and/or healthy controls and sample mean age and gender
  distribution were extracted. Correlations between the TAS-20 and the LEAS were
  subjected to a random effect of meta-analysis and moderators were explored in
  subgroup analyses and meta-regressions. Publication bias was considered.
  Results: 21 studies reporting on 28 independent samples on correlation
  analysis were included, encompassing a total of 2857 subjects (57\% women).
  The aggregated correlation between TAS-20 and LEAS was r = -0.122 (95\% CI
  [-0.180, -0.064]; Z = -4.092; p < 0.001), indicating a significant, but weak,
  negative relationship between the measures. Heterogeneity was moderate, but we
  found no indication of significant differences between patients with medical
  conditions, psychiatric disorders or healthy controls, nor that mean age or
  percentage of female subjects moderated the relationship. The overall estimate
  became somewhat weaker after adjusting for possible publication bias.
  Conclusions: Our results indicate that TAS-20 and LEAS measure different
  aspects of emotional functioning. The small overlap suggests that alexithymia
  and emotional awareness are distinct constructs of emotional well-being.
  Clinicians need to assess both aspects when considering treatment options for
  individual patients. Moreover, from the clinical standpoint, an easy reliable
  and valid way of measuring emotional awareness is still needed. More research
  should be focus on the differences between alexithymia and emotional awareness
  in specific conditions, but also how to integrate self-report instrument and
  observed based measures in a clinical situation. © 2018 Maroti, Lilliengren

  abstract = {One aspect of consciousness phenomena, the temporal emergence of
  visual awareness, has been subject of a controversial debate. How can visual
  awareness, that is the experiential quality of visual stimuli, be
  characterized best? Is there a sharp discontinuous or dichotomous transition
  between unaware and fully aware states, or does awareness emerge gradually
  encompassing intermediate states? Previous studies yielded conflicting results
  and supported both dichotomous and gradual views. It is well conceivable that
  these conflicting results are more than noise, but reflect the dynamic nature
  of the temporal emergence of visual awareness. Using a psychophysical
  approach, the present research tested whether the emergence of visual
  awareness is context-dependent with a temporal two-alternative forced choice
  task. During backward masking of word targets, it was assessed whether the
  relative temporal sequence of stimulus thresholds is modulated by the task
  (stimulus presence, letter case, lexical decision, and semantic category) and
  by mask type. Four masks with different similarity to the target features were
  created. Psychophysical functions were then fitted to the accuracy data in the
  different task conditions as a function of the stimulus mask SOA in order to
  determine the inflection point (conscious threshold of each feature) and slope
  of the psychophysical function (transition from unaware to aware within each
  feature). Depending on feature-mask similarity, thresholds in the different
  tasks were highly dispersed suggesting a graded transition from unawareness to
  awareness or had less differentiated thresholds indicating that clusters of
  features probed by the tasks quite simultaneously contribute to the percept.
  The latter observation, although not compatible with the notion of a sharp
  all-or-none transition between unaware and aware states, suggests a less
  gradual or more discontinuous emergence of awareness. Analyses of slopes of
  the fitted psychophysical functions also indicated that the emergence of
  awareness of single features is variable and might be influenced by the
  continuity of the feature dimensions. The present work thus suggests that the
  emergence of awareness is neither purely gradual nor dichotomous, but highly
  dynamic depending on the task and mask type.},

  work on whether parietal and frontal regions convey mnemonic information has
  yielded mixed findings. One possibility for this variability is that the
  mnemonic representations in high-level frontoparietal regions are modulated by
  attentional priority, such as temporal order. To test this hypothesis, we
  examined whether the most recent item, which has a higher attentional priority
  in terms of temporal order, is preferentially encoded in frontoparietal
  regions. On each trial, participants viewed 2 gratings with different
  orientations in succession, and were cued to remember one of them. Using fMRI
  and an inverted encoding model, we reconstructed population-level, orientation
  representations in occipital (V1-V3), parietal (IPS), and frontal (FEF) areas
  during memory maintenance. Unlike early visual cortex where robust orientation
  representations were observed regardless of serial order, parietal, and
  frontal cortices showed stronger representations when participants remembered
  the second grating. A subsequent experiment using a change detection task on
  color rings excluded the possibilities of residual stimulus-driven signals or
  motor preparative signals for responses. These results suggest that mnemonic
  representations in parietal and frontal cortices are modulated by
  temporal-order-based attentional priority signals. © The Author(s) 2018.

  abstract = {The empirical examination of the capacities and capabilities of
  the cognitive unconscious creates an ongoing debate, partly because each new
  piece of evidence may carry far-reaching implications for our understanding of
  consciousness, or, more generally, for our views on what is it like to be
  human. Adding to this discourse, the current chapter tackles the question by
  empirically and conceptually examining working memory (WM) and controlled
  processes, which--unlike their longtime companions, the automatic
  processes--are exclusively associated with conscious processing. Automatic
  cognitive processes are internal automatons that help us navigate a
  multifaceted and complex environment by slicing it into easily digestible
  bites. They may be unintentional, nonconscious, ballistic, and effortless, and
  can thus free our very-limited-capacity consciousness from many burdens.
  Controlled processes are usually thought of as the counterpart of automatic
  processes. They are intentional, conscious, and effortful, and hence allow
  more comprehensive information processing, one that exploits the richness and
  flexibility of consciousness and thus avoids the pitfalls of the narrow,
  one-track-minded automatons. In light of this prevalent view of automaticity
  and control, it is hardly surprising that the notion of nonconscious
  control--which appears in the title of this chapter--is widely held to be an
  oxymoron. On the most immediate level, this widespread belief appears to rest
  on pure logical grounds--how can (controlled) processes be conscious and
  nonconscious at the same time? But a closer look reveals that the notion of
  nonconscious controlled processes in higher cognition is disturbing for
  another deep reason: It suggests that mental processes, which are central to
  our conception of what it is to be human, occur outside of conscious awareness
  and have no phenomenology. Worries of this kind have led to a general
  disregard of the prospects of nonconscious controlled processes. This attitude
  continues to characterize the fields of cognitive psychology and social
  cognition despite the fact that research has started to yield evidence for
  nonconscious cognitive control in the area of automatic evaluation and
  stereotype use. The main purpose of this chapter is to advance the argument
  for nonconscious control and nonconscious controlled processes, and it does so
  in three ways: First, it presents systematic data which show that WM--the
  mental mechanism that is perhaps most associated with controlled, conscious
  processing--can operate outside of conscious awareness. Second, it reviews
  recent findings in social cognition and shows how they suggest that
  motivational aspects of WM can flexibly control behavior outside of conscious
  awareness. Last, it presents a conceptual analysis that starts by pointing out
  that the notion of control is used in more than one sense. Importantly, once
  the meanings of control are un-confounded, the relations of conscious
  awareness and cognitive control become a matter of empirical inquiry. Hence, I
  argue, the notion of nonconscious control is not an oxymoron and, indeed, it
  cannot be one--by definition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all

  abstract = {A common confound between consciousness and attention makes it
  difficult to think clearly about recent advances in the understanding of the
  visual brain. Visual consciousness involves phenomenal experience of the
  visual world, but visual attention is more plausibly treated as a function
  that selects and maintains the selection of potential conscious contents,
  often unconsciously. In the same sense, eye movements select conscious visual
  events, which are not the same as conscious visual experience. According to
  common sense, visual experience is consciousness, and selective processes are
  labeled as attention. The distinction is reflected in very different
  behavioral measures and in very different brain anatomy and physiology. Visual
  consciousness tends to be associated with the "what" stream of visual feature
  neurons in the ventral temporal lobe. In contrast, attentional selection and
  maintenance are mediated by other brain regions, ranging from superior
  colliculi to thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate. The author
  applied the common-sense distinction between attention and consciousness to
  the theoretical positions of M. I. Posner (1992, 1994) and D. LaBerge (1997,
  1998) to show how it helps to clarify the evidence. He concluded that clarity
  of thought is served by calling a thing by its proper name.},

  abstract = {A global workspace (GW) is a functional hub of binding and
  propagation in a population of loosely coupled signaling elements. In
  computational applications, GW architectures recruit many distributed,
  specialized agents to cooperate in resolving focal ambiguities. In the brain,
  conscious experiences may reflect a GW function. For animals, the natural
  world is full of unpredictable dangers and opportunities, suggesting a general
  adaptive pressure for brains to resolve focal ambiguities quickly and
  accurately. GW theory aims to understand the differences between conscious and
  unconscious brain events. In humans and related species the cortico-thalamic
  (C-T) core is believed to underlie conscious aspects of perception, thinking,
  learning, feelings of knowing (FOK), felt emotions, visual imagery, working
  memory, and executive control. Alternative theoretical perspectives are also
  discussed. The C-T core has many anatomical hubs, but conscious percepts are
  unitary and internally consistent at any given moment. Over time, conscious
  contents constitute a very large, open set. This suggests that a brain-based
  GW capacity cannot be localized in a single anatomical hub. Rather, it should
  be sought in a functional hub - a dynamic capacity for binding and propagation
  of neural signals over multiple task-related networks, a kind of neuronal
  cloud computing. In this view, conscious contents can arise in any region of
  the C-T core when multiple input streams settle on a winner-take-all
  equilibrium. The resulting conscious gestalt may ignite an any-to-many
  broadcast, lasting ∼100-200 ms, and trigger widespread adaptation in
  previously established networks. To account for the great range of conscious
  contents over time, the theory suggests an open repertoire of binding
  coalitions that can broadcast via theta/gamma or alpha/gamma phase coupling,
  like radio channels competing for a narrow frequency band. Conscious moments
  are thought to hold only 1-4 unrelated items; this small focal capacity may be
  the biological price to pay for global access. Visuotopic maps in cortex
  specialize in features like color, retinal size, motion, object identity, and
  egocentric/allocentric framing, so that a binding coalition for the sight of a
  rolling billiard ball in nearby space may resonate among activity maps of LGN,
  V1-V4, MT, IT, as well as the dorsal stream. Spatiotopic activity maps can
  bind into coherent gestalts using adaptive resonance (reentry). Single neurons
  can join a dominant coalition by phase tuning to regional oscillations in the
  4-12 Hz range. Sensory percepts may bind and broadcast from posterior cortex,
  while non-sensory FOKs may involve prefrontal and frontotemporal areas. The
  anatomy and physiology of the hippocampal complex suggest a GW architecture as
  well. In the intact brain the hippocampal complex may support conscious event
  organization as well as episodic memory storage.},

  abstract = {Conceptual short term memory (CSTM) is a theoretical construct
  that provides one answer to the question of how perceptual and conceptual
  processes are related. CSTM is a mental buffer and processor in which current
  perceptual stimuli and their associated concepts from long term memory (LTM)
  are represented briefly, allowing meaningful patterns or structures to be
  identified (Potter, 1993, 1999, 2009). CSTM is different from and
  complementary to other proposed forms of working memory: it is engaged
  extremely rapidly, has a large but ill-defined capacity, is largely
  unconscious, and is the basis for the unreflective understanding that is
  characteristic of everyday experience. The key idea behind CSTM is that most
  cognitive processing occurs without review or rehearsal of material in
  standard working memory and with little or no conscious reasoning. When one
  perceives a meaningful stimulus such as a word, picture, or object, it is
  rapidly identified at a conceptual level and in turn activates associated
  information from LTM. New links among concurrently active concepts are formed
  in CSTM, shaped by parsing mechanisms of language or grouping principles in
  scene perception and by higher-level knowledge and current goals. The
  resulting structure represents the gist of a picture or the meaning of a
  sentence, and it is this structure that we are conscious of and that can be
  maintained in standard working memory and consolidated into LTM. Momentarily
  activated information that is not incorporated into such structures either
  never becomes conscious or is rapidly forgotten. This whole cycle -
  identification of perceptual stimuli, memory recruitment, structuring,
  consolidation in LTM, and forgetting of non-structured material - may occur in
  less than 1 s when viewing a pictured scene or reading a sentence. The
  evidence for such a process is reviewed and its implications for the relation
  of perception and cognition are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016

  abstract = {Background: Insight is a specific part of the thinking process
  during creative problem solving. The experience of a sudden unexpected
  solution of the problem makes it distinct from other problem solving. Though
  the insight problem solving process is hidden from the observer and the solver
  himself, it is possible to study working memory changes during the
  problem-solving process in order to observe the tracks of insight. Objective:
  A critical experiment was carried out to determine whether it is legitimate to
  measure insight-problem-solving dynamics within a dual-task paradigm and
  working memory model. Also a verification was conducted of the hypothesis of
  whether insight problem solving competes for cognitive resources with
  unconscious processes. Design: We designed a special procedure based on
  Kahneman's (1973) modified dual-task paradigm, allowing simultaneous
  performance of the problem-solving process and probe tasks of different types.
  The reaction time was measured for the probe task. There were two problems
  conditions (insight and regular), and two probe tasks conditions (implicit and
  explicit). Participants: 32 participants, aged from 18 to 32 years (M = 19.81;
  sigma = 2.51). Results: Significant differences in implicit probe reaction
  time were found between the dual-task condition (implicit categorization and
  insight problem solving) and solo implicit probe condition (t(15) = -3.21, p =
  .006, d = -.76). A joint effect of problem type and probe type was found (F(1,
  60)= 4.85, p = .035, etap2 = .07). Conclusion: The results support the idea
  that information processing of conscious and of unconscious processes are
  separate. Unconscious processing capacity is limited. Implicit skill seems to
  be operated by the same mechanisms as insight problem solving, therefore
  competing for a common resource. It was also shown that such hidden creative
  unconscious processes as insight can be tracked via working memory load.

  abstract = {Reviews the book, The Conscious Brain: How Attention Engenders
  Experience by Jesse Prinz (2012). In this book, Prinz develops his AIR theory
  of consciousness. He envisages two stages that are necessary to establish a
  theory of consciousness. Firstly, there must be a particular process by which
  brain states become conscious. Secondly, we need to know where in the brain
  this occurs. Neural processing as such has no need of consciousness. There is
  now abundant evidence for unconscious processing and perception of stimuli.
  Something else is needed to push processing into consciousness. Prinz views
  the term qualia as interchangeable with phenomenal states, experiences, and
  feelings. Qualia are suggested to be mind dependent properties, in the sense

  mind (working memory) and irrelevant information out of mind (behavioural
  inhibition or interference resolution). Prefrontal cortex is essential for
  working memory and for interference resolution, but it is unknown whether
  these abilities are mediated by common or distinct prefrontal regions.
  Functional MRI was used to identify brain regions activated by separate
  manipulations of working memory load and interference within a single task
  (the Sternberg item recognition paradigm). Both load and interference
  manipulations were associated with performance decrements. Ss (aged 18-40 yrs)
  were unaware of the interference manipulation. There was a high degree of
  overlap between the regions activated by load and interference. Critically, no
  region was activated exclusively by interference. Several regions within this
  network exhibited a brain-behaviour correlation across Ss for the load or
  interference manipulation. Within the circuitry engaged by this task, some
  regions are more critically involved in the resolution of interference whereas
  others are more involved in the resolution of an increase in load. (PsycINFO

  qualia are different from other brain states in that they possess 3 functional
  characteristics, which the authors state in the form of "3 laws of qualia"
  based on a loose analogy with Newton's 3 laws of classical mechanics. First,
  they are irrevocable: the individual cannot simply decide to start seeing the
  sunset as green, or feel pain as if it were an itch; second, qualia do not
  always produce the same behaviour: given a set of qualia, individuals can
  choose from a potentially infinite set of possible behaviours to execute; and
  third, qualia endure in short-term memory, as opposed to non-conscious brain
  states involved in the on-line guidance of behaviour in real time. The authors
  suggest that qualia have evolved these and other attributes (e.g. they are
  "filled in") because of their role in facilitating non-automatic,
  decision-based action. They also suggest that the apparent epistemic barrier
  to knowing what qualia another person is experiencing can be overcome simply
  by using a "bridge" of neurons; and they offer a hypothesis about the relation
  between qualia and one's sense of self. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017

  abstract = {Blindsight and vision for action seem to be exemplars of
  unconscious visual processes. However, researchers have recently argued that
  blindsight is not really a kind of unconscious vision but is rather severely
  degraded conscious vision. Morten Overgaard and colleagues have recently
  developed new methods for measuring the visibility of visual stimuli. Studies
  using these methods show that reported clarity of visual stimuli correlates
  with accuracy in both normal individuals and blindsight patients. Vision for
  action has also come under scrutiny. Recent findings seem to show that
  information processed by the dorsal stream for online action contributes to
  visual awareness. Some interpret these results as showing that some dorsal
  stream processes are conscious visual processes (e.g., Gallese, 2007; Jacob \&
  Jeannerod, 2003). The aim of this paper is to provide new support for the more
  traditional view that blindsight and vision for action are genuinely
  unconscious perceptual processes. I argue that individuals with blindsight do
  not have access to the kind of purely qualitative color and size information
  which normal individuals do. So, even though people with blindsight have a
  kind of cognitive consciousness, visual information processing in blindsight
  patients is not associated with a distinctly visual phenomenology. I argue
  further that while dorsal stream processing seems to contribute to visual
  awareness, only information processed by the early dorsal stream (V1, V2, and
  V3) is broadcast to working memory. Information processed by later parts of
  the dorsal stream (the parietal lobe) never reaches working memory and hence
  does not correlate with phenomenal awareness. I conclude that both blindsight
  and vision for action are genuinely unconscious visual processes. (PsycINFO

  abstract = {Visual working memory provides an essential link between
  perception and higher cognitive functions, allowing for the active maintenance
  of information about stimuli no longer in view. Research suggests that
  sustained activity in higher-order prefrontal, parietal, inferotemporal and
  lateral occipital areas supports visual maintenance, and may account for the
  limited capacity of working memory to hold up to 3-4 items. Because
  higher-order areas lack the visual selectivity of early sensory areas, it has
  remained unclear how observers can remember specific visual features, such as
  the precise orientation of a grating, with minimal decay in performance over
  delays of many seconds. One proposal is that sensory areas serve to maintain
  fine-tuned feature information, but early visual areas show little to no
  sustained activity over prolonged delays. Here we show that orientations held
  in working memory can be decoded from activity patterns in the human visual
  cortex, even when overall levels of activity are low. Using functional
  magnetic resonance imaging and pattern classification methods, we found that
  activity patterns in visual areas V1-V4 could predict which of two oriented
  gratings was held in memory with mean accuracy levels upwards of 80\%, even in
  participants whose activity fell to baseline levels after a prolonged delay.
  These orientation-selective activity patterns were sustained throughout the
  delay period, evident in individual visual areas, and similar to the responses
  evoked by unattended, task-irrelevant gratings. Our results demonstrate that
  early visual areas can retain specific information about visual features held
  in working memory, over periods of many seconds when no physical stimulus is
  present. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

  2009-13155-012). In a recent study by R. R. Hassin and colleagues, half of the
  participants were informed of the occasional occurrence of location
  regularities (patterns) in visual stimulus sets, while the other half was not.
  Evidence was presented to the effect that uninformed participants extracted
  the patterns from the displays better than the informed participants. The
  authors interpret their finding as demonstrating that working memory (WM) can
  operate non-consciously. However, inspection of the data suggests that rather
  than being more effective than the informed participants in extracting
  patterns, uninformed participants were more strongly affected by the "Broken
  Patterns" that served as misleading cues. Thus whereas the findings may
  support the possibility of non-conscious operation of low level WM functions,
  they nevertheless underscore the importance of conscious awareness as far as
  higher level functions are concerned. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA,

  accounts suggest it primarily serves non-conscious visually guided action
  ('How'). Here, we identify three pathways emerging from the dorsal stream that
  consist of projections to the prefrontal and premotor cortices, and a major
  projection to the medial temporal lobe that courses both directly and
  indirectly through the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. These
  three pathways support both conscious and non-conscious visuospatial
  processing, including spatial working memory, visually guided action and
  navigation, respectively. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights

  abstract = {In the last decade, careful studies of the living brain have
  opened the way for human consciousness to return to the heights it held before
  the behavioristic coup of 1913. This is illustrated by seven cases: (1) the
  discovery of widespread brain activation during conscious perception; (2) high
  levels of regional brain metabolism in the resting state of consciousness,
  dropping drastically in unconscious states; (3) the brain correlates of-inner
  speech; (4) visual imagery; (5) fringe consciousness; (6) executive functions
  of the self; and (7) volition. Other papers in this issue expand on many of
  these points. (Roepstorff; Leopold Logothetis; Boerentsen; Haggard; Hohwy \&
  Frith). In the past, evidence based on subjective reports was often neglected
  (e.g., Ericsson, this issue). It is still true that brain evidence has greater
  credibility than subjective reports, no matter how reliable. What is new is
  increasing convergence between subjective experiences and brain observations.
  For that reason it is no longer rare to see the word `consciousness' and
  `subjectivity' in major science journals. No one so far has discovered a gulf
  dividing mind and brain. On the contrary, the new evidence supports the
  central role of consciousness as it was regarded over more than two millenia
  of written thought. In a sense this was predictable. Nature is full of
  unexpected convergences between fruit fly genes and the human body, between
  the arc of a tennis ball and the orbit of Mars, and between consciousness and
  the brain. These convergences show once again the remarkable unity of the
  observable universe.},

  abstract = {In this article, I argue that consciousness is a unique way of
  processing information, in that: it produces information, rather than purely
  transmitting it; the information it produces is meaningful for us; the meaning
  it has is always individuated. This uniqueness allows us to process
  information on the basis of our personal needs and ever-changing interactions
  with the environment, and consequently to act autonomously. Three main basic
  cognitive processes contribute to realize this unique way of information
  processing: the self, attention and working memory. The self, which is
  primarily expressed via the central and peripheral nervous systems, maps our
  body, the environment, and our relations with the environment. It is the
  primary means by which the complexity inherent to our composite structure is
  reduced into the ``single voice{''} of a unique individual. It provides a
  reference system that (albeit evolving) is sufficiently stable to define the
  variations that will be used as the raw material for the construction of
  conscious information. Attention allows for the selection of those variations
  in the state of the self that are most relevant in the given situation.
  Attention originates and is deployed from a single locus inside our body,
  which represents the center of the self, around which all our conscious
  experiences are organized. Whatever is focused by attention appears in our
  consciousness as possessing a spatial quality defined by this center and the
  direction toward which attention is focused. In addition, attention determines
  two other features of conscious experience: periodicity and phenomenal
  quality. Self and attention are necessary but not sufficient for conscious
  information to be produced. Complex forms of conscious experiences, such as
  the various modes of givenness of conscious experience and the stream of
  consciousness, need a working memory mechanism to assemble the basic pieces of
  information selected by attention.},

  and many calls have been made in support of the documentation and public

  to rectify these problems, including development of an international register
  for prospective reviews (PROSPERO) and launch of the first open access journal
  dedicated to the exclusive publication of systematic review products,
  including protocols (BioMed Central's Systematic Reviews). Furthering these
  efforts and building on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
  Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, an international group of experts has
  created a guideline to improve the transparency, accuracy, completeness, and
  frequency of documented systematic review and meta-analysis
  protocols--PRISMA-P (for protocols) 2015. The PRISMA-P checklist contains 17
  items considered to be essential and minimum components of a systematic review

  abstract = {The concept of perceptual memory refers to the neural and
  cognitive processes underlying the storage of specific stimulus features such
  as spatial frequency, orientation, shape, contrast, and color. Psychophysical
  studies of perceptual memory indicate that observers can retain visual
  information about the spatial frequency of Gabor patterns independent of the
  orientation with which they are presented. Compared to discrimination of
  gratings with the same orientation, reaction times to orthogonally oriented
  gratings, however, increase suggesting additional processing. Using
  event-related fMRI we examined the pattern of neural activation evoked when
  subjects discriminated the spatial frequency of Gabors presented with the same
  or orthogonal orientation. Blood-oxygen level dependent BOLD fMRI revealed
  significantly elevated bilateral activity in visual areas (V1, V2) when the
  gratings to be compared had an orthogonal orientation, compared to when they
  had the same orientation. These findings suggest that a change in an
  irrelevant stimulus dimension requires additional processing in primary and
  secondary visual areas. The finding that the task-irrelevant stimulus property
  (orientation) had no significant effect on the prefrontal and intraparietal
  cortex supports a model of working memory in which discrimination and
  retention of basic stimulus dimensions is based on low-level perceptual memory
  stores that are located at an early stage in the visual process. Our findings
  suggest that accessing different stores requires time and has higher metabolic
  costs. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Access to WM can be restricted on the basis of goal-relevant
  properties such as spatial location. However, the extent of voluntary control
  over which features of an attended multi-feature object are encoded and
  maintained in WM is debated. Some evidence suggests that attending to an
  object leads to obligatory storage of all of its features, whereas other
  evidence suggests that access to WM can be restricted to only goal-relevant
  features. Another possibility is that all features are initially encoded, but
  irrelevant features are removed from WM over time. To address these various
  possibilities, we used pattern classification of EEG signals to track the
  temporal evolution of representations reflecting the encoding and storage of
  task-relevant and irrelevant features in WM. In different blocks, participants
  remembered the orientation, color or both orientation and color of a colored,
  oriented grating. The color and orientation of the grating was randomly drawn
  from two distinct feature bins on each trial. To examine trial-specific
  activity reflecting storage of the object's features, a support vector machine
  (SVM) classifier was trained to classify what bin the stimulus features came
  from. Importantly, for orientation, the classifier produced reliably
  above-chance classification across the delay when orientation was
  task-relevant but not when it was task-irrelevant. Interestingly, orientation
  could be accurately classified on trials for which both orientation and color
  were remembered. Moreover, a separate measure corresponding to the probability
  of a feature belonging to the correct bin was significantly higher when
  orientation was task-relevant compared to task-irrelevant during encoding.
  Above-chance classification for color was only present during the initial 500
  msec across all conditions. Our results suggest that although information
  about all of an object's features is present in the initial stimulus-evoked
  neural response, information about the task-irrelevant features is attenuated
  during stimulus encoding and is largely absent throughout the delay.},

  abstract = {Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data has allowed the
  investigation of neural representations of stimuli on the basis of distributed
  patterns of activity within a brain region, independently from overall brain
  activity. For instance, several studies on early visual cortex have reported
  reliable MVPA decoding of the identity of a stimulus representation that was
  kept in working memory or internally generated, despite the fact that the
  overall BOLD response was low or even at baseline levels. Here we ask how it
  is possible that reliable stimulus information can be decoded from early
  visual cortex even when the overall BOLD signal remains low. We reanalyzed a
  data set in which human participants (N = 24) imagined or kept in working
  memory an oriented visual grating. We divided voxels from V1, V2, and V3 into
  groups based on orientation preference, and compared the time course of mean
  BOLD responses to preferred and non-preferred orientations with the time
  course of the multivariate decoding performance. Decoding accuracy related to
  a numerically small, but reliable univariate difference in the mean BOLD
  response to preferred and non-preferred stimuli. The time course of the
  difference in BOLD responses to preferred and non-preferred orientations was
  highly similar to the time course of the multivariate pattern classification
  accuracy. The reliability of the classification strongly correlated with the
  magnitude of differences in BOLD signal between preferred and non-preferred
  stimuli. These activity differences were small compared to the large overall
  BOLD modulations. This suggests that a substantial part of the task-related
  BOLD response to visual stimulation might not be stimulus-specific. Rather,
  stimulus-evoked BOLD signals in early visual cortex during a task context may
  be an amalgam of small stimulus-specific responses and large task-related but
  non-stimulus-specific responses. The latter are not evident during the
  maintenance or internal generation of stimulus representations, but provide an
  explanation of how reliable stimulus information can be decoded from early
  visual cortex even though its overall BOLD signal remains low.},

  BOLD signals in visual cortex during a task context are an amalgam of
  stimulus-specific and non-stimulus-specific processes, whereby a large part of
  the BOLD response to stimuli can be non-specific, both in terms of orientation
  selectivity and retinotopic specificity. On top of this relatively large
  orientation-unselective contribution is a small but reliable difference in
  stimulus-specific activity. This latter activity correlated highly with the

  abstract = {Currently influential models of working memory posit that memory
  content is highly accessible to conscious inspection. These models predict
  that metacognition of memory performance should go hand-in-hand with the
  accuracy of the underlying memory representation. To test this view, we
  investigated how visual information presented during the maintenance period
  affects VSTM accuracy and confidence. We used a delayed cue-target orientation
  discrimination task in which participants were asked to hold in memory a
  grating, and during the maintenance period a second memory cue could be
  presented. VSTM accuracy of the first memory cue was impaired when the
  orientation of the second memory cue was sufficiently different. However,
  participants' response confidence was reduced whenever the second memory cue
  was presented; thus VSTM accuracy and confidence were dissociated. In a second
  experiment, we applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the
  right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to investigate the causal role of
  this region in VSTM metacognition. Relative to the sham condition, anodal tDCS
  induced a general reduction in confidence ratings but did not affect VSTM
  accuracy. Overall, these results indicate that our metacognition of memory
  performance is influenced by factors other than the accuracy of the underlying
  memory representation. © 2014 Bona, Silvanto.},

  abstract = {‘Time-shrinking perception (TSP)’ is a unique perceptual
  phenomenon in which the duration of two successive intervals (T1 and T2)
  marked by three auditory stimuli is perceived as equal even when they are
  physically different. This phenomenon provides a link between time and working
  memory; however, previous studies have mainly been performed on the auditory
  modality but not the visual modality. To clarify the neural mechanism of
  visual TSP, we performed a psychophysical experiment and recorded
  event-related potentials (ERPs) under different T1/T2 combinations. Three
  successive black/white sinusoidal gratings (30 ms duration) were presented to
  the participants. In the psychophysical experiment, either T1 or T2 was varied
  from 240 to 560 ms in 40-ms steps, while T2 or T1 was fixed at 400 ms.
  Participants judged whether T1 and T2 were equal or not by pressing a button.
  ERPs were recorded from 128 scalp electrodes, while T1 was varied from 240,
  320, and 400 ms with the 400 ms T2 duration, and vice versa. Behavioral data
  showed asymmetrical assimilation: When −80 ms ≤ (T1 − T2) ≤ +120 ms, TSP was
  observed in the T1-varied condition. When −120 ms ≤ (T1 − T2) ≤ +80 ms, it was
  also observed in the T2-varied condition. These asymmetric time ranges in
  vision were different from those in the auditory modality. ERP data showed
  that contingent negative variation (CNV) appeared in the fronto-central region
  at around 300–500 ms during T2 presentation in the T1 T2 condition. In the
  /400/240/ pattern, P3 amplitude was greater than those of other temporal
  patterns. These neural responses corresponded to participants’ perception that
  T1 and T2 were not equal. The neural responses in the fronto-central region
  were involved with endogenous temporal attention for discrimination. Moreover,
  neural responses in the parietal region were engaged in exogenous temporal
  attention. Therefore, fronto-parietal neural responses underlie temporal
  perception in vision. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that activity patterns in
  early visual areas predict stimulus properties actively maintained in visual
  working memory. Yet, the mechanisms by which such information is represented
  remain largely unknown. In this study, observers remembered the orientations
  of 4 briefly presented gratings, one in each quadrant of the visual field. A
  10Hz Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) triplet was applied directly at
  stimulus offset, or midway through a 2-second delay, targeting early visual
  cortex corresponding retinotopically to a sample item in the lower hemifield.
  Memory for one of the four gratings was probed at random, and participants
  reported this orientation via method of adjustment. Recall errors were smaller
  when the visual field location targeted by TMS overlapped with that of the
  cued memory item, compared to errors for stimuli probed diagonally to TMS.
  This implied topographic storage of orientation information, and a
  memory-enhancing effect at the targeted location. Furthermore, early pulses
  impaired performance at all four locations, compared to late pulses. Next,
  response errors were fit empirically using a mixture model to characterize
  memory precision and guess rates. Memory was more precise for items proximal
  to the pulse location, irrespective of pulse timing. Guesses were more
  probable with early TMS pulses, regardless of stimulus location. Thus, while
  TMS administered at the offset of the stimulus array might disrupt early-phase
  consolidation in a non-topographic manner, TMS also boosts the precise
  representation of an item at its targeted retinotopic location, possibly by
  increasing attentional resources or by injecting a beneficial amount of noise.

  neural response. However, it is unclear whether this expectation suppression
  is an automatic phenomenon or is instead dependent on the type of task a
  subject is engaged in. To investigate this, human subjects were presented with
  visual grating stimuli in the periphery that were either predictable or
  non-predictable while they performed three tasks that differently engaged
  cognitive resources. In two of the tasks, the predictable stimulus was
  task-irrelevant and spatial attention was engaged at fixation, with a high
  load on either perceptual or working memory resources. In the third task, the
  predictable stimulus was task-relevant, and therefore spatially attended. We
  observed that expectation suppression is dependent on the cognitive resources
  engaged by a subjects' current task. When the grating was task-irrelevant,
  expectation suppression for predictable items was visible in retinotopically
  specific areas of early visual cortex (V1-V3) during the perceptual task, but
  it was abolished when working memory was loaded. When the grating was
  task-relevant and spatially attended, there was no significant effect of
  expectation in early visual cortex. These results suggest that expectation
  suppression is not an automatic phenomenon, but dependent on attentional state
  and type of available cognitive resources.},

  abstract = {Subliminal perception (SP) is today considered a well-supported
  theory stating that perception can occur without conscious awareness and have
  a significant impact on later behaviour and thought. In this article, we first
  present and discuss different approaches to the study of SP. In doing this, we
  claim that most approaches are based on a dichotomic measure of awareness.
  Drawing upon recent advances and discussions in the study of introspection and
  phenomenological psychology, we argue for both the possibility and necessity
  of using an elaborated measure of subjective states. In the second part of the
  article, we present findings where these considerations are implemented in an
  empirical study. The results and implications are discussed in detail, both
  with reference to SP, and in relation to the more general problem of using
  elaborate introspective reports as data in relation to studies of cognition.},

  abstract = {Working memory is fundamental to cognition, allowing one to hold
  information "in mind." A defining characteristic of working memory is its
  flexibility: we can hold anything in mind. However, typical models of working
  memory rely on finely tuned, content-specific attractors to persistently
  maintain neural activity and therefore do not allow for the flexibility
  observed in behavior. Here, we present a flexible model of working memory that
  maintains representations through random recurrent connections between two
  layers of neurons: a structured "sensory" layer and a randomly connected,
  unstructured layer. As the interactions are untuned with respect to the
  content being stored, the network maintains any arbitrary input. However, in
  our model, this flexibility comes at a cost: the random connections overlap,
  leading to interference between representations and limiting the memory
  capacity of the network. Additionally, our model captures several other key
  behavioral and neurophysiological characteristics of working memory.},

  abstract = {Blindsight refers to the rare ability of V1-damaged patients to
  perform visual tasks such as forced-choice discrimination, even though these
  patients claim not to consciously see the relevant stimuli. This striking
  phenomenon can be described in the formal terms of signal detection theory.
  (i) Blindsight patients use an unusually conservative criterion to detect
  targets. (ii) In discrimination tasks, their confidence ratings are low and
  (iii) such confidence ratings poorly predict task accuracy on a trial-by-trial
  basis. (iv) Their detection capacity (d') is lower than expected based on
  their performance in forced-choice tasks. We propose a unifying explanation
  that accounts for these features: that blindsight is due to a failure to
  represent and update the statistical information regarding the internal visual
  neural response, i.e. a failure in metacognition. We provide computational
  simulation data to demonstrate that this model can qualitatively account for
  the detection theoretic features of blindsight. Because such metacognitive
  mechanisms are likely to depend on the prefrontal cortex, this suggests that
  although blindsight is typically due to damage to the primary visual cortex,
  distal influence to the prefrontal cortex by such damage may be critical.
  Recent brain imaging evidence supports this view.},

  partially explained by the fact that different studies report the neural
  correlates of different conscious processes in the brain. More specifically,
  we distinguish between the perceptual awareness of a visual stimulus,
  associated to a boost in object-selective neural assemblies, and a more
  elaborate process (contextual awareness) that we argue is reflected in the
  firing of concept neurons in the medial temporal lobe, triggering a rich

  serial biases in spatial working memory. Stimulus information was not

  with the strength of serial biases in both monkeys and humans, as predicted by
  a computational model that integrates activity-based and activity-silent

  situations where the data for a specific predictor do not lie close to the

  location and accuracy effects, respectively. The performance of the three new

  effects is investigated in a simulation study. We conclude that the new

  ratio of the standard deviation of the random effects to the effect of
  interest. Consequently, the CV provides a different measure of the extent of
  heterogeneity in a meta-analysis relative to the effect being measured.
  However, very large CV values can occur when the effect is small making

  consider variants of the CV that exist in the interval 0 , 1 which may be
  preferable for some researchers. Second, we provide interval estimators for
  the CV and its variants with excellent coverage properties. We perform

  confidence intervals using the propagating imprecision method or, as a simpler

  the dissimilarities. Such an arrangement can be obtained by multidimensional
  scaling (MDS). We propose a method for the inverse process: inferring the
  pairwise dissimilarities from multiple 2D arrangements of items. Perceptual
  dissimilarities are classically measured using pairwise dissimilarity
  judgments. However, alternative methods including free sorting and 2D
  arrangements have previously been proposed. The present proposal is novel (a)
  in that the dissimilarity matrix is estimated by "inverse MDS" based on
  multiple arrangements of item subsets, and (b) in that the subsets are
  designed by an adaptive algorithm that aims to provide optimal evidence for
  the dissimilarity estimates. The subject arranges the items (represented as
  icons on a computer screen) by means of mouse drag-and-drop operations. The
  multi-arrangement method can be construed as a generalization of simpler
  methods: It reduces to pairwise dissimilarity judgments if each arrangement
  contains only two items, and to free sorting if the items are categorically
  arranged into discrete piles. Multi-arrangement combines the advantages of
  these methods. It is efficient (because the subject communicates many
  dissimilarity judgments with each mouse drag), psychologically attractive
  (because dissimilarities are judged in context), and can characterize
  continuous high-dimensional dissimilarity structures. We present two
  procedures for estimating the dissimilarity matrix: a simple
  weighted-aligned-average of the partial dissimilarity matrices and a
  computationally intensive algorithm, which estimates the dissimilarity matrix
  by iteratively minimizing the error of MDS-predictions of the subject's
  arrangements. The Matlab code for interactive arrangement and dissimilarity
  estimation is available from the authors upon request.},

  influences the classification of a subsequent target. Most subliminal-priming
  claims are based on separate target- and prime-classification tasks. Because
  primes are intended to be subliminal, the prime-classification task is
  difficult, and the target-classification task is easy. To assess whether this
  task-difficulty difference accounts for previous claims of subliminal priming,
  we manipulated the ease of the prime-classification task by intermixing
  long-duration (visible) primes with short-duration (near liminal) ones. In
  Experiment 1, this strategy of intermixing long-duration primes raised
  classification of the short-duration ones. In Experiments 2 and 3, prime
  duration was lowered in such a way that prime classification was at chance in
  intermixed presentations. Under these conditions, we failed to observe any
  priming effects; hence, previous demonstrations of subliminal priming may
  simply have reflected a task-difficulty artifact.},

  permutation and ad hoc methods for testing with the random effects model.
  Under the group permutation method, we randomly switch the treatment and
  control group labels in each trial. This idea is similar to using a
  permutation distribution for a community intervention trial where communities
  are randomized in pairs. The permutation method theoretically controls the
  type I error rate for typical meta-analyses scenarios. We also suggest two ad
  hoc procedures. Our first suggestion is to use a t-reference distribution with
  k-1 degrees of freedom rather than a standard normal distribution for the
  usual random effects test statistic. We also investigate the use of a simple
  t-statistic on the reported treatment effects.},

  cortex and its role in this cognitive process. First, we present evidence from
  brain-imaging studies that prefrontal cortex shows sustained activity during
  the delay period of visual working memory tasks, indicating that this cortex
  maintains on-line representations of stimuli after they are removed from view.
  We then present evidence for domain specificity within frontal cortex based on
  the type of information, with object working memory mediated by more ventral
  frontal regions and spatial working memory mediated by more dorsal frontal
  regions. We also propose that a second dimension for domain specificity within
  prefrontal cortex might exist for object working memory on the basis of the
  type of representation, with analytic representations maintained
  preferentially in the left hemisphere and image-based representations
  maintained preferentially in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, we discuss the
  possibility that there are prefrontal areas brought into play during the
  monitoring and manipulation of information in working memory in addition to
  those engaged during the maintenance of this information. Finally, we consider
  the relationship of prefrontal areas important for working memory, both to
  posterior visual processing areas and to prefrontal areas associated with

  Visual working memory tasks, in which subjects retain the memory of a stimulus

  the subsequent maintenance of its representation after the stimulus is removed
  from view. Such tasks activate multiple areas in visual and prefrontal
  cortices. To delineate the roles these areas play in perception and working
  memory maintenance, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
  obtain dynamic measures of neural activity related to different components of
  a face working memory task-non-selective transient responses to visual
  stimuli, selective transient responses to faces, and sustained responses over
  memory delays. Three occipitotemporal areas in the ventral object vision
  pathway had mostly transient responses to stimuli, indicating their
  predominant role in perceptual processing, whereas three prefrontal areas
  demonstrated sustained activity over memory delays, indicating their
  predominant role in working memory. This distinction, however, was not
  absolute. Additionally, the visual areas demonstrated different degrees of
  selectivity, and the prefrontal areas demonstrated different strengths of
  sustained activity, revealing a continuum of functional specialization, from
  occipital through multiple prefrontal areas, regarding each area's relative
  contribution to perceptual and mnemonic processing.},

  seven chunks in short-term memory (STM) tasks. However, that number was meant
  more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device than as a real capacity
  limit. Others have since suggested that there is a more precise capacity
  limit, but that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article
  brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the
  smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in analyses of
  information processing only if the boundary conditions for observing them can
  be carefully described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be
  identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when
  information overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when
  other steps are taken specifically to block the recording of stimulus items
  into larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by the capacity
  limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these
  conditions, rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus
  items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms that are not
  capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the capacity-limited storage
  mechanism to be refilled during recall. A single, central capacity limit
  averaging about four chunks is implicated along with other,
  noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks
  is distinguished from compound STM limits obtained when the number of
  separately held chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall
  within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the focus of
  attention is proposed.},

  abstract = {Factorial experiments in research on memory, language, and in
  other areas are often analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). However,
  for effects with more than one numerator degrees of freedom, e.g., for
  experimental factors with more than two levels, the ANOVA omnibus F-test is
  not informative about the source of a main effect or interaction. Because
  researchers typically have specific hypotheses about which condition means
  differ from each other, a priori contrasts (i.e., comparisons planned before
  the sample means are known) between specific conditions or combinations of
  conditions are the appropriate way to represent such hypotheses in the
  statistical model. Many researchers have pointed out that contrasts should be
  “tested instead of, rather than as a supplement to, the ordinary ‘omnibus’ F
  test” (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this tutorial, we explain the mathematics
  underlying different kinds of contrasts (i.e., treatment, sum, repeated,
  polynomial, custom, nested, interaction contrasts), discuss their properties,
  and demonstrate how they are applied in the R System for Statistical Computing
  (R Core Team, 2018). In this context, we explain the generalized inverse which
  is needed to compute the coefficients for contrasts that test hypotheses that
  are not covered by the default set of contrasts. A detailed understanding of
  contrast coding is crucial for successful and correct specification in linear
  models (including linear mixed models). Contrasts defined a priori yield far
  more useful confirmatory tests of experimental hypotheses than standard
  omnibus F-tests. Reproducible code is available from https://osf.io/7ukf6/.},

  increasing popularity, it is important that researchers are aware of who

  quality, it remains unclear how big this problem is. To understand how these
  characteristics impact experiment presentation and data quality, we performed
  a battery of automated tests on a number of representative setups. We
  investigated how different web-building platforms (Gorilla, jsPsych, Lab.js,
  and psychoJS/PsychoPy3), browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari), and
  operating systems (mac OS and Windows 10) impact display time across 30
  different frame durations for each software combination. In addition, we
  employed a robot actuator in representative setups to measure response
  recording across aforementioned platforms, and between different keyboard
  types (desktop and integrated laptop). We then surveyed over 200 000
  participants on their demographics, technology, and software to provide
  context to our findings. We found that modern web-platforms provide a
  reasonable accuracy and precision for display duration and manual response
  time, but also identify specific combinations that produce unexpected variance
  and delays. While no single platform stands out as the best in all features
  and conditions, our findings can help researchers make informed decisions
  about which experiment building platform is most appropriate in their
  situation, and what equipment their participants are likely to have.},

  abstract = {Summary A general class of statistical models for a univariate
  response variable is presented which we call the generalized additive model
  for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). The model assumes independent
  observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory
  variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the
  response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of
  distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete
  distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling
  not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the
  distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth)
  functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum
  (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A
  Newton–Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized)
  likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting
  algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data
  sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the
  generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of agreement among experts in a classification task
  is crucial in many situations (e.g., medical and psychological diagnosis,
  legal reports). Traditional indexes used to estimate interrater agreement
  (such as Cohen's j) simply count the number of observed agreements and correct
  them by removing chance agreements. In this article, we introduce a new
  theoretical framework for the evaluation of interrater agreement based on the
  possibility of adjusting the observed classifications conducted by the raters.
  This framework refers to the introduction and formalization of two concepts
  involved in the classification task: (a) the belonging measure of an object to
  a category and (b) the rater's belonging threshold, which is the minimally
  sufficient value of the belonging measure at which the rater will classify an
  object into a category. These factors are ignored by traditional indexes for
  interrater agreement, though their role may be decisive. Two Bayesian models
  are tested through a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the accuracy of
  the new methodology for estimating raters' threshold and the actual degree of
  agreement between two independent raters. Results show that the computation of
  traditional indexes for interrater agreement on the adjusted classifications
  leads to a more accurate estimation of the experts' actual agreement. This
  improvement is greater when a large difference between raters' belonging
  thresholds is observed; when the difference is small, the proposed method
  provides similar results to those obtained in the simple observed
  classifications. Finally, an empirical application to the field of
  psychological assessment is presented to show how the method could be used in
  practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {The ability to hold information briefly in mind in the absence of
  external stimulation forms the core of much of higher-order cognition. This
  ability is referred to as short-term memory (STM). However, single-term labels
  such as this belie the complexity of the underlying construct. Here, we review
  evidence that STM is an amalgamation of three qualitatively distinct states.
  We argue that these distinct states emerge from the combination of frontal
  selection mechanisms (often considered the domain of attention and cognitive
  control), medial temporal binding mechanisms (often considered the domain of
  long-term memory, LTM), and synaptic plasticity. These various contributions
  lead to a single representation amenable to elaborated processing (focus of
  attention), a limited set of active representations among which attention can
  be flexibly switched (direct-access region), and passive representations whose
  residual traces facilitate re-activation (activated LTM). We suggest that
  selection and binding mechanisms are typically engaged simultaneously,
  providing multiple forms and routes of short-term maintenance. We propose that
  such a framework can resolve discrepancies among recent studies that have
  attempted to understand the relationship between attention and STM on the one

  prior to a visual colour search display. Both response times to targets and
  event-related brain potentials (ERPs) reflecting spatial attention (EDAN,

  spatial attention shifts by subliminal central words; neither significant ERPs

  To control for the processing of the subliminal words, we included trials with
  a congruent or incongruent target word (left or right) in a classic target
  discrimination task in Experiment 2, and additionally analyzed an ERP
  reflecting semantic congruence, the N400. We mainly replicated the results
  from Experiment 1 (no spatial attention shifts by subliminal words) and found
  a difference depending on the congruence between subliminal word and target
  word (N400) as well as a negative congruence effect in the reaction times.
  These findings demonstrate that the subliminal word was processed. We

  been influential in the field of consciousness studies. Both Block and Lamme
  proposed that access consciousness, or narrow cognitive accessibility, is
  related to a limited capacity working memory, and that phenomenal
  consciousness, or broad cognitive accessibility, is related to iconic memory
  or, more recently, to a fragile (intermediate) short-term memory store with a
  larger capacity than working memory. They have also highlighted the
  preattentive nature of phenomenal consciousness and of the related iconic and
  fragile visual short-term stores, thus selectively linking attention with
  access consciousness, in line with Baars and Dehaene, among others. However, a
  range of electrophysiological and neurophysiological studies suggest that
  visual attention can affect early responses of neurons in visual cortex,
  before conscious access. Furthermore, some theories and neurocomputational
  models suggest earlier attentional biases related to phenomenal consciousness.
  To solve this controversy, and to shed light on the relationships of attention
  with iconic memory and subsequent stages of visual maintenance, we conducted
  an experiment with a novel procedure of change detection based on delayed
  cueing of the target for report with high- and low-priority objects marked by
  color. In line with our hypothesis, the results show an attentional bias
  toward high-priority objects in the memory array with the longer (600 and
  1,200 ms) cueing delays associated with a fragile (intermediate) visual
  short-term memory, but not with the shorter cueing delays (16.6 and 200 ms)
  associated with iconic memory. These findings therefore suggest two stages of
  phenomenal consciousness before access consciousness: a first preattentive
  stage related to iconic memory and a second stage related to fragile visual
  short-term memory intermediate between iconic and visual working memory, which
  is modulated by visual attention in a time-dependent manner. Finally, our
  results suggest the dissociation between a mid-level visual attention
  modulating phenomenal consciousness and a central attention directing access
  consciousness.},

  "Unconscious Memory Representations in Perception "focuses on the role of
  implicit (non-conscious) memories in processing sensory information. Making
  sense of the wealth of information arriving at our senses requires implicit
  memories, which represent environmental regularities, contingencies of the
  sensory input, as well as general contextual knowledge. Recent findings and
  theories in cognitive and computational neuroscience provided new insights
  into the structure and contents of implicit memory representations. The
  chapters of this book examine implicit memories both in relatively simple
  situations, such as perceiving auditory and visual objects, as well as in
  high?level cognitive functions, such as speech and music perception and
  aesthetic experience. By nature, implicit memories cannot be directly studied
  with behavioral methods. Therefore, a large part of the evidence reviewed was
  obtained in neuroscientific studies. Readers with limited experience in
  neuroscience will find information about the most commonly used techniques in

  test this hypothesis, this study investigated the influence of PRD on the
  filtering ability of happy, angry, and neutral facial distractors from visual

  assigned to a PRD (n = 24) or a non-PRD group (n = 24). Filtering ability was
  reflected by comparing the contralateral delay activity (CDA) amplitude for

  measured as the difference in mean amplitudes between activity in the
  hemispheres contralateral and ipsilateral to the to-be-remembered information.

  to filter out neutral and angry facial distractors, as reflected by similar
  CDA amplitudes for one-target-one-distractor and two-targets conditions for
  both angry and neutral distractors in the PRD group. However, PRD did not
  impair the ability to filter out happy facial distractors, as reflected by
  similar CDA amplitudes for one-target-one-distractor and one-target conditions

  contribution of specific rapid attentional processes to successful encoding is
  largely unknown. To investigate this issue, we leveraged the high temporal
  resolution of electroencephalographic recordings to directly link a cascade of
  visuo-attentional neural processes to successful encoding: namely (1) the N2pc
  (peaking ~200 ms), which reflects stimulus-specific attentional orienting and
  allocation, (2) the sustained posterior-contralateral negativity (post-N2pc),
  which has been associated with sustained visual processing, (3) the
  contralateral reduction in oscillatory alpha power (contralateral reduction in
  alpha > 200 ms), which has also been independently related to attentionally
  sustained visual processing. Each of these visuo-attentional processes was
  robustly predictive of successful encoding, and, moreover, each enhanced
  memory independently of the classic, longer-latency, conceptually related,
  difference-due-to memory (Dm) effect. Early latency midfrontal theta power
  also promoted successful encoding, with at least part of this influence being
  mediated by the later latency Dm effect. These findings markedly expand

  search has been heavily debated in the literature and has proven challenging
  to investigate behaviorally. In this research, we used an electrophysiological
  index of working memory (contralateral delay activity) to passively measure
  working memory activity during visual search. Participants were asked to
  indicate whether a novel target was present or absent in a lateralized search
  array with three visual set sizes (2, 4, or 6). If rejected distractors are
  maintained in working memory during search, working memory activity should
  increase with the number of distractors that need to be evaluated. Therefore,
  we predicted the amplitude of the contralateral delay activity would be larger
  for target-absent trials and would increase with visual set size until WM
  capacity was reached. In Experiment 1, we found no evidence for distractor
  maintenance in working memory during search for real-world stimuli. In
  Experiment 2, we found partial evidence in support of distractor maintenance
  during search for stimuli with high target/distractor similarity. In both
  experiments, working memory capacity did not appear to be a limiting factor
  during visual search. These results suggest the role of working memory during
  search may depend on the visual search task in question. Maintaining
  distractors in working memory appears to be unnecessary during search for

  abstract = {The change detection task is a widely used paradigm to examine
  visual working memory processes. Participants memorize a set of items and
  then, try to detect changes in the set after a retention period. The negative
  slow wave (NSW) and contralateral delay activity (CDA) are event-related
  potentials in the EEG signal that are commonly used in change detection tasks
  to track working memory load, as both increase with the number of items
  maintained in working memory (set size). While the CDA was argued to more
  purely reflect the memory-specific neural activity than the NSW, it also
  requires a lateralized design and attention shifts prior to memoranda onset,
  imposing more restrictions on the task than the NSW. The present study
  proposes a novel change detection task in which both CDA and NSW can be
  measured at the same time. Memory items were presented bilaterally, but their
  distribution in the left and right hemifield varied, inducing a target
  imbalance or “net load.” NSW increased with set size, whereas CDA increased
  with net load. In addition, a multivariate linear classifier was able to
  decode the set size and net load from the EEG signal. CDA, NSW, and decoding
  accuracy predicted an individual's working memory capacity. In line with the
  notion of a bilateral advantage in working memory, accuracy, and CDA data
  suggest that participants tended to encode items relatively balanced. In sum,

  explored the effects of acute stress on human WM processing using

  times. Cold pressor stress (CPS) was used as stressful treatment, while warm
  water was used as the control treatment before the WM task. Exposure to CPS
  was associated with a significant increase in blood pressure and salivary
  cortisol. After the 3-min resting period, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
  diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for the CPS session significantly increased
  relative to the control treatment session (all p ≤ 0.01), and data also showed
  a significant increase of 20-min post-treatment cortisol concentration (p <
  0.001) for CPS. Data from the CPS session showed significantly longer reaction
  times, lower accuracy, and WM capacity scores than that of the control
  treatment session. Interestingly, a difference between the two sessions was
  also found in N2pc and the late contralateral delay activity (late CDA)
  components. Specifically, although non-significant main effects of treatment
  were found for N2pc amplitudes, there was a significant interaction between
  treatments and stimuli conditions (processing load) [F(2,46) = 3.872, p =
  0.028, η2 p = 0.14], which showed a pronounced trend toward equalization of
  N2pc amplitude across stimuli conditions during the CPS session clearly
  different from that of control treatment. As for amplitudes for late CDA, a

  abstract = {Threat stimuli catch our attention when compared with neutral
  stimuli called attention bias, which includes facilitating attention
  engagement and difficult attention disengagement to threat. Acute stress
  influences our attention to threat. However, we do not know whether acute
  stress can enhance facilitating attention engagement or impair attention
  disengagement toward threat. Therefore, the present study investigated whether
  attention engagement to threat is enhanced or attention disengagement to
  threat is weakened when people are stressed. Thirty-six healthy male adults
  were randomly assigned to a stress group (n = 18) and a control group (n =
  18). The stress group underwent socially evaluated cold pressor test (SECPT),
  whereas the control group underwent a warm water control protocol. The
  dot-probe task was used to measure the attention bias toward threat.
  Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used in conjunction with reaction time
  measures to investigate the time course of attention to threat in the
  dot-probe task. The N2-posteior-contralateral (N2pc) component measured the
  initial shift of visual attention to the threatening stimulus, whereas the
  sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN) component measured the
  maintenance of visual attention to the threatening stimulus. Reaction time,
  accuracy rate, and the electroencephalography data of the participants were
  recorded during the dot-probe task. The state anxiety questionnaire and saliva
  were acquired at five time points, such as 85 and 70 minutes before the SECPT,
  immediately before and after the dot-probe task, and 70 minutes after the
  SECPT. The SECPT successfully induced stress response. Participants in the
  stress group showed stronger state anxiety and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal
  axis response indicated by increased salivary cortisol concentration after the
  SECPT than the control group. In addition, no significant differences were
  found before the SECPT. At the behavioral level, the attention disengagement
  in the stress group was slower than in the control group. Regarding ERPs, we
  found a greater amplitude of SPCN (300~600 ms after cue) in the stress group
  than in the control group. However, no significant effect was found on the
  amplitude of N2pc between stress group and control group. These results
  indicate that attention disengagement toward threat is impaired under acute

  choice between two tasks, people tend to choose tasks requiring less cognitive
  effort. Such demand avoidance (DA) is associated with cognitive control, but
  it is still not clear to what extent individual differences in cognitive
  control can account for variations in DA. We sought to elucidate the relation
  between cognitive control and cognitive effort preferences by investigating
  the extent to which sustained neural activity in a task requiring cognitive
  control is correlated with DA. We hypothesized that neural measures of
  efficient filtering will predict individual variations in demand preferences.
  To test this hypothesis, we had participants perform a delayed-match-to-sample
  paradigm with their ERPs recorded, as well as a separate behavioral
  demand-selection task. We focused on the ERP correlates of cognitive filtering
  efficiency (CFE)—the ability to ignore task-irrelevant distractors during
  working memory maintenance—as it manifests in a modulation of the
  contralateral delay activity, an ERP correlate of cognitive control. As
  predicted, we found a significant positive correlation between CFE and DA.
  Individuals with high CFE tended to be significantly more demand avoidant than
  their low-CFE counterparts. Low-CFE individuals, in comparison, did not form
  distinct cognitive effort preferences. Overall, our results suggest that
  cognitive control over the contents of visual working memory contribute to
  individual differences in the expression of cognitive effort preferences. This
  further implies that these observed preferences are the product of sensitivity

  studies put forth evidence for the presence of a distributed VWM network
  involving also prefrontal areas and in particular the anterior cingulate
  cortex (ACC). Nonetheless, the understanding of the functional role of ACC is
  still debated. We recorded the high-density EEG in 20 healthy participants

  statistics confirmed the posterior memory load dependent CDA modulation, but
  also identified an additional anterior cluster of electrodes whose amplitude
  was modulated by memory load. The source reconstruction revealed a memory load
  dependent activation in the IPS but also in the ACC, suggesting that these two
  areas might be nodes of a fronto-parietal circuit underlying VWM maintenance.
  Crucially, parietal and prefrontal areas showed a temporal dissociation, since
  IPS was more engaged in the early phase of visual information storage while
  the ACC was more active during the late phase. This pattern suggests a
  functional dissociation between the parietal cortex, which is involved in
  encoding and storage of information, and prefrontal areas, subserving
  cognitive control processes, including the boosting and protection of

  filtering, we conducted two studies to directly assess the impact of
  reward-related distracters on working memory. In both studies, the distracters
  consisted of colored bars or circles that were previously associated with

  distracters did not impact behavioral measures of working memory filtering
  efficiency compared to neutral distracters. In Experiment 2, using ERPs, we
  measured the contralateral delay activity (CDA), a psychophysiological index
  of the number of items retained in working memory, to further assess filtering
  efficiency. We observed that the CDA for high reward distracters was similar
  to low reward and neutral distracters. However, in early trials, behavioral
  measures revealed that previously rewarded stimuli negatively impacted working
  memory capacity, an effect not observed with neutral distracters. This effect,
  though, was not found for the CDA in early trials. In summary, our findings

  Here, we investigate whether the contralateral-delay activity (CDA), a

  In two independent experiments, we presented participants with a sequence of

  temporal order by indicating whether a subsequently presented probe image was
  originally displayed during the first or the second half of the sequence. As a
  main novel result, we report the emergence of a contralateral negativity
  already following the presentation of the first item of the sequence, which
  increases over the course of a trial with every presented item, up to a limit
  of four items. We further observed no differences in the CDA during the
  temporal-order task compared to one obtained during a task concerning the

  capacity of working memory, can be held in an active and accessible state.
  Thus, it is important to select and maintain information that is relevant
  while ignoring irrelevant information. However, the underlying neural
  mechanism of these processes has yet to be identified. One potential candidate
  are alpha oscillations (8–14 Hz), which have been shown to inhibit stimulus
  processing in perceptual tasks. During memory maintenance, alpha power
  increases with set size suggesting that alpha oscillations are involved either
  in memory maintenance or in the inhibition of task-irrelevant information to
  protect relevant information from interference. The need for such a protection
  should increase with the amount of distracting information, but most previous
  studies did not show any distractors. Therefore, we directly tested whether
  alpha oscillations are involved in inhibition of distractors during memory
  maintenance. Participants memorized the orientation of one or two target lines
  embedded among irrelevant distractors. Distractors were either strong or weak
  and were present during the retention interval after which participants
  reported the orientation of probed targets. Computational modeling showed that
  performance decreased with increasing set size and stronger distraction. Alpha
  power in the retention interval generally increased with set size, replicating
  previous studies. However, here stronger distractors reduced alpha power. This
  finding is in clear contradistinction to previous suggestions, as alpha power
  decrease indicates higher neuronal excitability. Thus, our data do not support

  representations. To challenge this received view, we measured
  electrophysiological markers of attentional selection (N2pc component) and
  working memory (sustained posterior contralateral negativity; SPCN) in search
  tasks where two possible targets were defined by feature conjunctions (e.g.,
  blue circles and green squares). Critically, some search displays also
  contained nontargets with two target features (incorrect conjunction objects,
  e.g., blue squares). Because featurebased guidance cannot distinguish these
  objects from targets, any selective bias for targets will reflect object-based
  attentional control. In Experiment 1, where search displays always contained
  only one object with target-matching features, targets and incorrect
  conjunction objects elicited identical N2pc and SPCN components, demonstrating
  that attentional guidance was entirely feature-based. In Experiment 2, where
  targets and incorrect conjunction objects could appear in the same display,
  clear evidence for object-based attentional control was found. The target N2pc
  became larger than the N2pc to incorrect conjunction objects from 250 ms
  poststimulus, and only targets elicited SPCN components. This demonstrates
  that after an initial feature-based guidance phase, object-based templates are
  activated when they are required to distinguish target and nontarget objects.
  These templates modulate visual processing and control access to working

  representation using two components of the event-related potential (ERP): the
  contralateral delay activity (CDA), reflecting short-term visual memory, and
  the anterior P170, reflecting long-term storage. We additionally tracked
  attentional preparation and deployment in the contingent negative variation
  (CNV) and N2pc, respectively. Results show that only the reward pre-cue
  impacted our ERP indices of memory. However, both types of cue elicited a
  robust CNV, reflecting an influence on task preparation, both had equivalent
  impact on deployment of attention to the target, as indexed in the N2pc, and
  both had equivalent impact on visual search behavior. Reward prospect thus has
  an influence on memory-guided visual search, but this does not appear to be
  necessarily mediated by a change in the visual memory representations indexed
  by CDA. Our results demonstrate that the impact of motivation on search is not
  a simple product of improved memory for target templates. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  means of the contralateral delay activity (CDA) during a change detection task
  in which composite objects (notched shapes abutting an occluding shape) to be
  memorized were primed to induce either a globally completed object or a
  noncompleted, mosaic representation. The results revealed an effect of
  completion in VWM despite physically identical visual input: change detection
  was more accurate for completed compared with mosaic representations when
  observers were required to memorize two objects, and these differences were
  reduced with four memorized items. At the electrophysiological level, globally
  completed (vs. mosaic) objects gave rise to a corresponding increase in CDA
  amplitudes. These results indicate that although incorporating the occluded
  portions of the presented shapes requires mnemonic resources, the complete
  object representations thus formed in VWM improve change detection performance
  by providing a more simple, regular shape. Overall, these findings demonstrate

  multisensory working memory (WM) tasks, where stimuli from different
  modalities have to be simultaneously maintained. Performance decrements
  relative to unimodal single-task baselines have been attributed to a
  modality-unspecific central WM store, but such costs could also reflect
  increased demands on central executive processes involved in dual-task
  coordination. To compare these hypotheses, we asked participants to maintain
  two, three, or four visual items. Unimodal trials, where only this visual task
  was performed, and bimodal trials, where a concurrent tactile WM task required
  the additional maintenance of two tactile items, were randomly intermixed. We
  measured the visual and tactile contralateral delay activity (CDA/tCDA
  components) as markers of WM maintenance in visual and somatosensory areas.
  There were reliable dual-task costs, as visual CDA components were reduced in
  size and visual WM accuracy was impaired on bimodal relative to unimodal
  trials. However, these costs did not depend on visual load, which caused
  identical CDA modulations in unimodal and bimodal trials, suggesting that
  memorizing tactile items did not reduce the number of visual items that could
  be maintained. Visual load did not also affect tCDA amplitudes. These findings
  indicate that bimodal dual-task costs do not result from a competition between
  multisensory items for shared storage capacity. Instead, these costs reflect
  generic limitations of executive control mechanisms that coordinate multiple
  cognitive processes in dual tasks. Our results support hierarchical models of
  WM, where distributed maintenance processes with modality-specific capacity
  limitations are controlled by a central executive mechanism. © 2018

  WM might play in lying: holding the truth-related information and turning the

  goal, a deception task based on the old/new recognition paradigm was designed,
  which could manipulate two levels of WM load (low-load task using 4 items and
  high-load task using 6 items) during the deception process. The analyses based
  on the amplitude of the contralateral delay activity (CDA), a proved index of
  the number of representations being held in WM, showed that the CDA amplitude
  was lower in the deception process than that in the truth telling process
  under the high-load condition. In contrast, under the low-load condition, no
  CDA difference was found between the deception and truth telling processes.
  Therefore, we deduced that the lie construction and information storage
  compete for WM resources; when the available WM resources cannot meet this
  cognitive demand, the WM resources occupied by the information storage would
  be consumed by the lie construction. © 2017 Liu et al. This is an open access

  abstract = {Human visual system receives many cluttered stimuli
  simultaneously, but only a few of visual representations can be held in the
  mind to guide subsequent goal-oriented behaviors, which indicates the limited
  capacity of visual working memory. Meanwhile, the neural representations of
  visual stimuli can be noisy and hence the memory precision is varying. This
  review systematically illustrates the roles of neural oscillations in
  maintaining visual working memory and neural mechanisms underlying the
  capacity and precision. In the end, several potential directions of this field
  for future studies are discussed. A large amount of researches demonstrates
  that during the maintenance of visual working memory representations, the
  theta band oscillations can facilitate the neural information communications
  between brain regions throughout a relative long distance, in order to achieve
  the top-down cognitive control; the alpha band oscillations, which was
  initially considered as an electrophysiological correlate of cortical idling,
  are now generally treated to reflect functional inhibition or non-engagement
  of a given brain regions, in order to gate neural information to the
  task-relevant regions; as for gamma band, the high frequency oscillation
  property make it suitable for the integration of multiple object features in
  the local neural network and hold the relevant representations. Therefore,
  theta and gamma band engage in the maintenance of working memory
  representations directly, while alpha oscillations serve in an indirect way of
  functional inhibition. In addition, the cross frequency coupling and neural
  synchronization enable the collaboration of different brain regions in the
  working memory network. The contralateral delay activity (CDA) is widely
  acknowledged to be an online electrophysiological marker of working memory
  capacity. In addition, the alpha oscillations in irrelevant regions also have
  a strong correlation with individual capacity. Early studies that aimed to
  explore memory capacity limit introduce the slot model of working memory,
  which regards working memory as few fixed discrete slots and cannot be divided
  between items. However, more and more experiments that are designed to study
  memory precision come to conceptualize working memory as a limited resource
  that can be shared between different representations, and put forward the
  resource model of working memory. One of the major differences of these two
  models is the change of memory precision with memory load increasing, so the
  study of memory precision is conductive to figure out the working memory
  model. Although several behavioral studies have demonstrated that both
  capacity and precision are two distinct aspects of working memory, some
  electrophysiological researches propose that CDA and alpha band oscillations
  can also represent the memory precision. Therefore, more studies would be
  needed to explore the neural substrates of memory precision. In addition to
  the passive maintenance of working memory representations, the active
  manipulation of memories, such as updating, is a potential direction of
  working memory studies, since it can give us a whole picture of how the memory
  resources are dynamically distributed among objects. Moreover, neural decoding
  of objects is also an important research perspective, which can directly
  manifest the storage of memory representations. © 2016, Science Press. All

  a spatial cuing paradigm to investigate the origins of this persisting

  irrelevant color cue that was either contingent (color search) or
  non-contingent (shape search) on attentional sets was presented prior to a
  target array with different stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOA; 200, 400, 800
  ms). Behavioral results indicated that color cues captured attention only when
  they shared target-defining properties. These same-location effects persisted
  over time but were pronounced when cue and target array were presented in
  close succession. N2 posterior contralateral (N2pc) showed that the color cue
  generally drew attention, but was strongest in the contingent condition. A
  subsequently emerging contralateral posterior positivity referred to the
  irrelevant cue (i.e., distractor positivity, Pd) was unaffected by the
  attentional set and therefore interpreted as an inhibitory process required to
  enable a re-direction of the attentional focus. Contralateral delay activity
  (CDA) was only observable in the contingent condition, indicating the transfer
  of spatial information into working memory and thus providing an explanation
  for the same-location effect for longer SOAs. Inhibition of this irrelevant
  information was reflected by a second contralateral positivity triggered
  through target presentation. The results suggest that distracting information
  is actively maintained when it resembles a sought-after object. However, two
  independent attentional processes are at work to compensate for attentional
  distraction: the timely inhibition of attentional capture and the active

  supports the maintenance of task-relevant information during the retention
  delay of WM tasks. The tactile contralateral delay activity (tCDA) component
  of the event-related potential (ERP) marks the attention-based rehearsal of
  tactile information in somatosensory brain regions. We tested whether the tCDA
  reflects the competition for shared attention resources between a WM task and
  a perceptual task under dual-task conditions. The two tasks were always
  performed on opposite hands. In different blocks, the WM task had higher or
  lower priority than the perceptual task.The tCDA's polarity consistently
  reflected the hand where the currently prioritized task was performed. This
  suggests that the process indexed by the tCDA is not specific to the domain of
  WM, but mediated by a domain-unspecific attention mechanism. The analysis of
  transient ERP components evoked by stimuli in the two tasks further supports
  the interpretation that the tCDA marks a goal-directed bias in the allocation
  of selective attention. Larger spatially selective modulations were obtained
  for stimulus material related to the high-, as compared to low-priority, task.
  While our results generally indicate functional overlap between the domains of

  neural correlates underlying these benefits to VWM performance remain unclear.
  One neural index, the contralateral delay activity (CDA), is an event-related
  potential that shows increased amplitude according to the number of items held
  in VWM and asymptotes at an individual’s VWM capacity limit. Here, we applied
  the CDA to determine whether previously reported behavioral benefits supplied

  savings such that the CDA amplitude was reduced when these cues were present.
  We implemented VWM change-detection tasks with arrays including similarity and
  proximity (Experiment 1); uniform connectedness (Experiments 2a and 2b); and
  similarity/proximity and uniform connectedness (Experiment 3). The results
  indicated that when there was a behavioral benefit to VWM, this was echoed by
  a reduction in CDA amplitude, which suggests more efficient processing.
  However, not all perceptual grouping cues provided a VWM benefit in the same
  measure (e.g., accuracy) or of the same magnitude. We also found unexpected
  interactions between cues. We observed a mixed bag of effects, suggesting that
  these powerful perceptual grouping benefits are not as predictable in VWM. The

  examined the effects of directing attention toward versus away from the
  targets, no previous research has assessed how attentional allocation varies
  as a function of target-flanker distance in crowding. Here, we used ERPs to
  assess the operation of attention during crowding, focusing on the
  attention-related N2pc component. We used a typical crowding task in which
  participants were asked to report the category (vowel/consonant) of a
  lateralized target letter flanked by distractor letters at different
  distances. We tested the hypothesis that attention fails when the
  target-flanker distance becomes too small for attention to operate
  effectively. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that N2pc amplitude was
  maximal at intermediate target–flanker distances and decreased substantially
  when crowding became severe. In addition, we examined the sustained posterior
  contralateral negativity (SPCN), which reflects the amount of information
  being maintained in working memory. Unlike the N2pc component, the SPCN
  increased in amplitude at small target–flanker distances, suggesting that
  observers stored information about the target and flankers in working memory
  when attention failed to select the target. Together, the N2pc and SPCN
  results suggest that attention and working memory play distinctive roles in

  Importantly, we find that the mCDA also receives contribution from current
  sources in the ventral extrastriate cortex that display a time-course similar

  modeling of ERP data reveals that the ventral sources have non-optimal

  then met and stayed stationary, or moved separately, met, and then continued
  to move together. We monitored the object representations on-line using the
  contralateral delay activity (CDA; an ERP component indicative of the number

  disappeared and became working memory representations. The results
  demonstrated that the objects' representations (as indicated by the CDA

  (when the objects "met" and remained stationary on the same position). Only a
  strong common fate Gestalt cue (when the objects not just met but also moved
  together) was able to override the objects' initial separate status, creating
  an integrated representation. These results challenge the view that Gestalt

  phase, HTA individuals were highly inefficient at filtering the irrelevant
  items from WM, as reflected not only by parallel late contralateral delay
  activity (CDA; 450 to 900 ms) amplitudes for the distractor condition and the
  four red items, but also by a smaller filtering efficiency score in the HTA

  repetitions permit re-using some control settings from the previous trial. By

  participants' filtering mechanisms to enhance visual working memory (WM)
  efficiency. The highly restricted nature of visual WM capacity renders
  efficient filtering mechanisms crucial for its successful functioning.
  Filtering efficiency in visual WM can be measured via the lateralized change
  detection task with distractors. From an array of items, only a subsample must
  be memorized (targets), whereas distractors must be filtered out. From the EEG
  recorded while items are maintained in memory, slow potentials over posterior
  recording sides can be extracted. In addition, the contralateral delay
  activity (CDA) can be calculated as the difference wave between contralateral
  and ipsilateral slow potentials. As the amplitudes of contralateral slow
  potentials and CDA reflect the number of remembered items, one can infer if
  distractors were filtered out. Efficient filtering mechanisms are also highly
  important in multiple object tracking (MOT). We trained participants'
  filtering ability with the aid of this latter task. Filtering in both tasks is
  assumed to happen via allocation of selective attention. We observed large
  training-induced improvements in MOT. However, these improvements did not
  transfer to improved filtering mechanisms in the change detection task.
  Instead, we obtained suggestive evidence for an overall improvement in

  the expected life-span peak in younger adults and better performance with

  CDA amplitude and decreased behavioral performance in younger adults. Both
  effects were less pronounced in older adults. Children showed a unique
  pattern: Their behavioral load effects were as strong as those of younger
  adults, but their CDA was unaffected by load. With long presentation times,

  that the ipsilateral hemisphere is also involved in memory-related processes.
  This ipsilateral activity might either reflect a bilateral processing of

  Participants were asked to remember one color, four identical colors or four

  because it contains the same amount of identity information as that of one
  color while the same amount of location information as that of four distinct

  replicates this finding and uses magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterize

  throughout the memory delay. A parametric manipulation of memory load, within
  and beyond capacity limits, allows separation of signals that asymptote with
  behavioral VSTM performance from additional responses that contribute to a
  linear increase with set-size. Both EEG and MEG yielded bilateral signals that
  track the number of objects held in memory, and contralateral signals that are
  independent of memory load. In MEG, unlike EEG, the contralateral interaction
  between hemisphere and item load is much weaker, suggesting that bilateral and
  contralateral markers of memory load reflect distinct sources to which EEG and
  MEG are differentially sensitive. Nonetheless, source estimation allowed both
  the bilateral and the weaker contralateral capacity-limited responses to be
  localized, along with a load-independent contralateral signal. Sources of
  global and hemisphere-specific signals all localized to the posterior
  intraparietal sulcus during the early delay. However the bilateral load
  response peaked earlier and its generators shifted later in the delay.
  Therefore the hemifieldspecific response may be more closely tied to memory

  rotation is accomplished by transforming a representation held in visual
  short-term memory (VSTM). In order to accomplish this goal, we utilized the
  sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN), an electrophysiological
  index of the maintenance of information in VSTM. We hypothesized that if
  mental rotation is accomplished by transforming a representation held in VSTM,
  then the duration that this representation is maintained in VSTM should be
  related to the degree to which the representation must be rotated to reach the
  desired orientation. Therefore, the SPCN should offset at progressively longer
  latencies as the degree of rotation required increases. We tested this
  prediction in two experiments utilizing rotated alphanumeric characters.
  Experiment 1 utilized a normal versus mirror discrimination task that is known
  to require mental rotation. Experiment 2 utilized a letter versus digit
  discrimination, a task that does not require mental rotation. In Experiment 1,
  the offset latency of the SPCN wave increased with increases in the angle of
  rotation of the target. This effect indicates that targets were maintained in
  VSTM for longer durations as the angle of rotation increased. Experiment 2
  revealed that target orientation did not affect SPCN offset latency when
  subjects did not adopt a mental rotation strategy, confirming that the effects
  on the SPCN latency effects observed in Experiment 1 were not due to the mere
  presentation of rotated patterns. Thus, these two experiments provide clear
  evidence that mental rotation involves representations maintained in VSTM. ©

  Recent experiments have demonstrated an electrophysiological marker of VWM

  demands. Here, we investigate whether the CDA is evident during visual search,
  a thoroughly-researched task that is a hallmark of visual attention but has no

  demonstrate that the CDA is present during a lateralized search task, and that
  it is similar in amplitude to the CDA observed in a change-detection task, but
  peaks slightly later. The changes in CDA amplitude during search were strongly
  correlated with VWM capacity, as well as with search efficiency. These results

  VWM capacity and search efficiency.Conclusions/Significance:We conclude that

  whether and how the fine detailed information is stored in VWM, four
  experiments have been conducted while recording the contralateral delay

  manipulated by adopting simple objects and complex objects as materials. We
  found the amplitude of CDA was modulated by object complexity: as the set size

  maintaining complex objects with detailed information, while continued
  increasing for storing highly discriminable simple objects. These results
  suggest that VWM can store the fine detailed information; however it can not
  store all the fine detailed information from 4 complex objects. It implies
  that the capacity of VWM is not only characterized by a fixed number of
  objects, there is at least one stage influenced by the detailed information
  contained in the objects. These results are further discussed within a

  abstract = {Background: In predictive spatial cueing studies, reaction times
  (RT) are shorter for targets appearing at cued locations (valid trials) than
  at other locations (invalid trials). An increase in the amplitude of early P1
  and/or N1 event-related potential (ERP) components is also present for items
  appearing at cued locations, reflecting early attentional sensory gain control
  mechanisms. However, it is still unknown at which stage in the processing
  stream these early amplitude effects are translated into latency effects.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we measured the latency of two ERP
  components, the N2pc and the sustained posterior contralateral negativity
  (SPCN), to evaluate whether visual selection (as indexed by the N2pc) and
  visual-short term memory processes (as indexed by the SPCN) are delayed in
  invalid trials compared to valid trials. The P1 was larger contralateral to
  the cued side, indicating that attention was deployed to the cued location
  prior to the target onset. Despite these early amplitude effects, the N2pc
  onset latency was unaffected by cue validity, indicating an express,
  quasiinstantaneous re-engagement of attention in invalid trials. In contrast,
  latency effects were observed for the SPCN, and these were correlated to the
  RT effect. Conclusions/Significance: Results show that latency differences
  that could explain the RT cueing effects must occur after visual selection
  processes giving rise to the N2pc, but at or before transfer in visual
  short-term memory, as reflected by the SPCN, at least in discrimination tasks
  in which the target is presented concurrently with at least one distractor.

  spatial attention. The aim of this paper was to study the effects of masking
  on the N2pc. Two stimuli were presented on the screen, one to left and one to
  right of fixation, and subjects reported the identity of one of them. The
  targets could be discriminated both by their category (letters vs. digit) and
  by their colour (pink vs. green). Backward masking was produced by presenting
  a second pair of bilateral stimuli after the offset of the first pair. The
  second pair of stimuli consisted of characters of the same colour and category
  as in the first pair. Forward masking was produced by using the very same
  stimuli as in the backward masking condition, but by instructing subjects to
  report the second stimulus. The forward mask trials had longer response times
  compared to no-mask trials, and backward mask trials had even longer response
  times, and also a higher error rate. Although the different masking procedures
  lead to clear behavioural effects, the N2pc was not affected, suggesting that
  the deployment of visual spatial attention, per se, was not affected by
  pattern masking. A sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN)
  following the N2pc was also found (300 ms post-target, and beyond), and the
  amplitude of the SPCN was strongly modulated by the number of presented
  stimuli and the duration of the SPCN was positively correlated with RT in the

  objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and

  studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is
  used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as
  the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments
  of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the
  effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes

  Since tempting actions are often contextually inappropriate, selective
  suppression is invoked to inhibit such actions. Thus far, laboratory tasks
  have not been very successful in highlighting these processes. We suggest that
  this is for three reasons. First, it is important to dissociate between an
  early susceptibility to making stimulus-driven impulsive but erroneous
  actions, and the subsequent selective suppression of these impulses that
  facilitates the selection of the correct action. Second, studies have focused
  on mean or median reaction times (RT), which conceals the temporal dynamics of
  action control. Third, studies have focused on group means, while considering
  individual differences as a source of error variance. Here, we present an
  overview of recent behavioral and imaging studies that overcame these
  limitations by analyzing RT distributions. As will become clear, this approach
  has revealed variations in inhibitory control over impulsive actions as a
  function of task instructions, conflict probability, and between-trial
  adjustments (following conflict or following an error trial) that are hidden
  if mean RTs are analyzed. Next, we discuss a selection of behavioral as well
  as imaging studies to illustrate that individual differences are meaningful
  and help understand selective suppression during action selection within
  samples of young and healthy individuals, but also within clinical samples of
  patients diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or
  Parkinson's disease.},

  with a set of items on a questionnaire. The response format for these
  questions is often simply binary (e.g., yes/no) or ordered (e.g., high, medium
  or low). During data analysis, these items are frequently summed or used to
  estimate factor scores. In clinical applications, such assessments are often
  non-normally distributed in the general population because many respondents
  are unaffected, and therefore asymptomatic. As a result, in many cases these
  measures violate the statistical assumptions required for subsequent analyses.
  To reduce the influence of the non-normality and quasi-continuous assessment,
  variables are frequently recoded into binary (affected-unaffected) or ordinal
  (mild-moderate-severe) diagnoses. Ordinal data therefore present challenges at
  multiple levels of analysis. Categorizing continuous variables into ordered
  categories typically results in a loss of statistical power, which represents
  an incentive to the data analyst to assume that the data are normally
  distributed, even when they are not. Despite prior zeitgeists suggesting that,
  e.g., variables with more than 10 ordered categories may be regarded as
  continuous and analyzed as if they were, we show via simulation studies that
  this is not generally the case. In particular, using Pearson product-moment
  correlations instead of maximum likelihood estimates of polychoric
  correlations biases the estimated correlations towards zero. This bias is
  especially severe when a plurality of the observations fall into a single
  observed category, such as a score of zero. By contrast, estimating the
  ordinal correlation by maximum likelihood yields no estimation bias, although
  standard errors are (appropriately) larger. We also illustrate how odds ratios
  depend critically on the proportion or prevalence of affected individuals in
  the population, and therefore are sub-optimal for studies where comparisons of
  association metrics are needed. Finally, we extend these analyses to the
  classical twin model and demonstrate that treating binary data as continuous
  will underestimate genetic and common environmental variance components, and
  overestimate unique environment (residual) variance. These biases increase as
  prevalence declines. While modeling ordinal data appropriately may be more
  computationally intensive and time consuming, failing to do so will likely
  yield biased correlations and biased parameter estimates from modeling them.},

  the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from
  (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource
  constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a
  desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the
  absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying
  sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to
  which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes.
  Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider
  1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size
  will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what
  they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected
  based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of
  effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power
  analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area.
  Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article, for example by
  using the interactive form in the accompanying online Shiny app, to improve
  their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value

  The normal quantile plot, like the funnel plot, can be used to investigate
  whether all studies come from a single population and to search for
  publication bias. However, the normal quantile plot is easier to interpret
  than the funnel plot, especially when it includes 95\% confidence bands. In
  addition, the normal quantile plot can be used to check the normality
  assumption for numerical procedures. The funnel plot cannot be used for this
  latter purpose. Most people have heard the phrase, "A picture is worth a
  thousand words." This phrase seems especially applicable to producers and
  consumers of metaanalytic reviews. In a meta-analysis, graphical displays
  (figures, plots) can be used to enhance numerical analyses in at least two
  ways. First, graphical displays can be used to discover patterns and relations
  among variables in a meta-analysis. Second, graphical displays can be used to
  check statistical assumptions on which numerical analyses are based. One of
  the most popular graphical displays for exploring meta-analytic data sets is
  the funnel plot (Light \& Pillemer, 1984). In this article, we begin by

  zero and (b) taking the rejection of a null hypothesis on the basis of a
  significant p value to imply a scientifically important finding In many common

  counternull is defined in general, even with multi-degree-of-freedom effect

  recent evidence suggests the intriguing possibility that NDEs may refer to
  actually "perceived," and stored, experiences (although not necessarily in
  relation to the external physical world). We adopted an integrated approach
  involving a hypnosis-based clinical protocol to improve recall and decrease
  memory inaccuracy together with electroencephalography (EEG) recording in
  order to investigate the characteristics of NDE memories and their neural
  markers compared to memories of both real and imagined events. We included 10
  participants with NDEs, defined by the Greyson NDE scale, and 10 control
  subjects without NDE. Memories were assessed using the Memory Characteristics
  Questionnaire. Our hypnosis-based protocol increased the amount of details in
  the recall of all kind of memories considered (NDE, real, and imagined
  events). Findings showed that NDE memories were similar to real memories in
  terms of detail richness, self-referential, and emotional information.
  Moreover, NDE memories were significantly different from memories of imagined
  events. The pattern of EEG results indicated that real memory recall was
  positively associated with two memory-related frequency bands, i.e., high
  alpha and gamma. NDE memories were linked with theta band, a well-known marker
  of episodic memory. The recall of NDE memories was also related to delta band,
  which indexes processes such as the recollection of the past, as well as
  trance states, hallucinations, and other related portals to transpersonal
  experience. It is notable that the EEG pattern of correlations for NDE memory
  recall differed from the pattern for memories of imagined events. In
  conclusion, our findings suggest that, at a phenomenological level, NDE
  memories cannot be considered equivalent to imagined memories, and at a neural
  level, NDE memories are stored as episodic memories of events experienced in a
  peculiar state of consciousness.},

  that emotional behavior. We tested this hypothesis in 9 children (Mage = 5.66)

  is a neurological congenital disorder characterized by underdevelopment of the

  communicate emotions through the face. We therefore assessed Moebius
  children's autonomic response to emotional stimuli (video cartoons) by means
  of functional infrared thermal (fIRT) imaging. Patients showed weaker
  temperature changes compared to controls, suggesting impaired autonomic
  activity. They also showed difficulties in recognizing facial emotions from
  static illustrations. These findings reveal that the impairment of facial
  movement attenuates the intensity of emotional experience, probably through
  the diminished activation of autonomic responses associated with emotional
  stimuli. The current study is the first to investigate emotional responses in
  MBS children, providing important insights into the role of facial expressions

  treatment for more than 6 months. At the end of 6 months of SHD and 6 months
  of DHD in a sequence of randomly assigned 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring,
  echocardiography and bioimpedance were performed. Throughout the study,
  patients maintained the same Kt/V. A significant reduction in 24-hour BP
  during DHD was reported (systolic BP [lsqb ]SBP[rsqb ]: DHD, 128 [plusmn] 11.6

  during DHD (DHD, 120.1 [plusmn] 60.4 g/m2; SHD, 148.7 [plusmn] 59.7 g/m2; P

  24-hour SBP (r [equals] 0.63; P [lt ] 0.01) and LVMI (r [equals] 0.66; P [lt ]

  Bayesian method was the most liberal and also showed the greatest concordance
  between the experimental paradigms (active/passive). ANOVA detected
  significant effect only in cases with converging evidence from other methods.

  or more elaborate forms of information processing. Contemporary models equate
  consciousness with global processing, system complexity, or depth or stability
  of computation. This is in stark contrast with the powerful philosophical
  intuition that being conscious is more than just having the ability to
  compute. I argue that it is also incompatible with current empirical findings.
  I present a model that is free from the strong assumption that consciousness
  predicts superior performance. The model is based on Bayesian decision theory,
  of which signal detection theory is a special case. It reflects the fact that
  the capacity for perceptual decisions is fundamentally limited by the presence
  and amount of noise in the system. To optimize performance, one therefore
  needs to set decision criteria that are based on the behaviour, i.e. the
  probability distributions, of the internal signals. One important realization
  is that the knowledge of how our internal signals behave statistically has to
  be learned over time. Essentially, we are doing statistics on our own brain.
  This 'higher-order' learning, however, may err, and this impairs our ability
  to set and maintain optimal criteria for perceptual decisions, which I argue
  is central to perception consciousness. I outline three possibilities of how
  conscious perception might be affected by failures of 'higher-order'
  representation. These all imply that one can have a dissociation between
  consciousness and performance. This model readily explains blindsight and
  hallucinations in formal terms, and is beginning to receive direct empirical
  support. I end by discussing some philosophical implications of the model.},

  Variants of this question have preoccupied researchers in a wide range of
  domains, from mainstream experimental psychology (cognition, perception,
  social behavior) to cognitive neuroscience and behavioral economics. A
  pervasive view places a heavy explanatory burden on an intelligent cognitive
  unconscious, with many theories assigning causally effective roles to
  unconscious influences. This article presents a novel framework for evaluating
  these claims and reviews evidence from three major bodies of research in which
  unconscious factors have been studied: multiple-cue judgment, deliberation
  without attention, and decisions under uncertainty. Studies of priming
  (subliminal and primes-to-behavior) and the role of awareness in movement and
  perception (e.g., timing of willed actions, blindsight) are also given brief
  consideration. The review highlights that inadequate procedures for assessing
  awareness, failures to consider artifactual explanations of ``landmark{''}
  results, and a tendency to uncritically accept conclusions that fit with our
  intuitions have all contributed to unconscious influences being ascribed
  inflated and erroneous explanatory power in theories of decision making. The
  review concludes by recommending that future research should focus on tasks in
  which participants' attention is diverted away from the experimenter's
  hypothesis, rather than the highly reflective tasks that are currently often
  employed.},

  potential estimates provided by electric source imaging (ELECTRA). All faces,

  subcortical afferents to temporal areas as suggested in some studies involving

  influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate
  intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow
  the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian
  framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the
  system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity
  using experimentally designed inputs and fMRI responses. In this context, the
  coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear
  parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing
  framework allows one to characterise fMRI experiments, conceptually, as an
  experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or
  trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked
  responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with
  previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally
  induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However,
  unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes
  responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: When multiple endpoints are of interest in evidence
  synthesis, a multivariate meta-analysis can jointly synthesise those endpoints
  and utilise their correlation. A multivariate random-effects meta-analysis
  must incorporate and estimate the between-study correlation (rhoB). METHODS:
  In this paper we assess maximum likelihood estimation of a general normal
  model and a generalised model for bivariate random-effects meta-analysis
  (BRMA). We consider two applied examples, one involving a diagnostic marker
  and the other a surrogate outcome. These motivate a simulation study where
  estimation properties from BRMA are compared with those from two separate
  univariate random-effects meta-analyses (URMAs), the traditional approach.
  RESULTS: The normal BRMA model estimates rhoB as -1 in both applied examples.
  Analytically we show this is due to the maximum likelihood estimator sensibly
  truncating the between-study covariance matrix on the boundary of its
  parameter space. Our simulations reveal this commonly occurs when the number
  of studies is small or the within-study variation is relatively large; it also
  causes upwardly biased between-study variance estimates, which are inflated to
  compensate for the restriction on rhoB. Importantly, this does not induce any
  systematic bias in the pooled estimates and produces conservative standard
  errors and mean-square errors. Furthermore, the normal BRMA is preferable to
  two normal URMAs; the mean-square error and standard error of pooled estimates
  is generally smaller in the BRMA, especially given data missing at random. For
  meta-analysis of proportions we then show that a generalised BRMA model is
  better still. This correctly uses a binomial rather than normal distribution,
  and produces better estimates than the normal BRMA and also two generalised
  URMAs; however the model may sometimes not converge due to difficulties
  estimating rhoB. CONCLUSION: A BRMA model offers numerous advantages over
  separate univariate synthesises; this paper highlights some of these benefits
  in both a normal and generalised modelling framework, and examines the
  estimation of between-study correlation to aid practitioners.},

  boundary estimate of zero for the (residual) between-study standard deviation,
  resulting in fixed-effects estimates of the other parameters and their
  standard errors. To avoid such boundary estimates, we suggest using Bayes
  modal (BM) estimation with a gamma prior on the between-study standard
  deviation. When no prior information is available regarding the magnitude of
  the between-study standard deviation, a weakly informative default prior can
  be used (with shape parameter 2 and rate parameter close to 0) that produces
  positive estimates but does not overrule the data, leading to only a small
  decrease in the log likelihood from its maximum. We review the most commonly
  used estimation methods for meta-analysis and meta-regression including
  classical and Bayesian methods and apply these methods, as well as our BM
  estimator, to real datasets. We then perform simulations to compare BM
  estimation with the other methods and find that BM estimation performs well by
  (i) avoiding boundary estimates; (ii) having smaller root mean squared error

  detection theoretic measures provide an excellent method for avoiding response
  bias confounds, and many researchers correctly adopt this approach. However,
  here we discuss how a fixation on avoiding criterion effects can also be
  misleading and detrimental to fruitful inquiry. In a recent paper, Balsdon and
  Azzopardi (Absolute and relative blindsight. Consciousness and Cognition 2015;
  32:79-91.) claimed that contamination by response bias led to flawed findings
  in a previous report of "relative blindsight". We argue that their criticisms
  are unfounded. They mistakenly assumed that others were trying (and failing)
  to apply their preferred methods to remove bias, when there was no such
  intention. They also dismissed meaningful findings because of their dependence
  on criterion, but such dismissal is problematic: many real effects necessarily
  depend on criterion. Unfortunately, these issues are technically tedious, and
  we discuss how they may have confused others to misapply psychophysical
  metrics and to draw questionable conclusions about the nature of TMS
  (transcranial magnetic stimulation)-induced blindsight. We conclude by
  discussing the conceptual importance of criterion effects in studies of
  conscious awareness: we need to treat them carefully, but not to avoid them

  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements from 43 subjects
  while they viewed masked faces and houses that were either subjectively or

  representations in anterior, category-selective ventrotemporal areas were less
  robust. For subjectively invisible stimuli, similar to visible stimuli, there
  was a clear posterior-to-anterior gradient in visual cortex, with stronger
  category information in ventrotemporal cortex than in early visual cortex. For
  objectively invisible stimuli, however, category information remained
  virtually unchanged from early visual cortex to object- and category-selective
  visual areas. These results demonstrate that although both objectively and
  subjectively invisible stimuli are represented in visual cortex, the extent of

  dissociation between a measure of perception with awareness and a measure that
  is sensitive to perception without awareness or to demonstrate a qualitative
  difference between the consequences of perception with and without awareness.
  Awareness has been controlled either by manipulating the stimulus conditions
  or by instructing observers on how to distribute their attention. The
  experimental findings based on all four approaches lead to the same
  conclusion; namely, stimuli are perceived even when observers are unaware of
  the stimuli. This conclusion is supported by results of studies in which
  awareness has been assessed with either objective measures of forced-choice
  discriminations or measures based on verbalizations of subjective conscious
  experiences. Given this solid empirical support for the concept of perception
  without awareness, a direction for future research studies is to assess the
  functions of information perceived without awareness in determining what is
  perceived with awareness. The available evidence suggests that information
  perceived without awareness both biases what stimuli are perceived with

  were visually primed to prepare for the alternative (i.e., "wrong") task, and
  this impaired their performance. This priming effect is taken to depend on
  unconscious processes because the effect was present even when the volunteers

  Furthermore, the effect was stronger when the visibility of the prime was near
  zero than when the visibility of the prime was significantly higher. When

  was also decreased neural activity in the brain areas relevant to the

  abstract = {This introductory chapter attempts to clarify the philosophical,
  empirical, and theoretical bases on which a cognitive neuroscience approach to
  consciousness can be founded. We isolate three major empirical observations
  that any theory of consciousness should incorporate, namely (1) a considerable
  amount of processing is possible without consciousness, (2) attention is a
  prerequisite of consciousness, and (3) consciousness is required for some
  specific cognitive tasks, including those that require durable information
  maintenance, novel combinations of operations, or the spontaneous generation
  of intentional behavior. We then propose a theoretical framework that
  synthesizes those facts: the hypothesis of a global neuronal workspace. This
  framework postulates that, at any given time, many modular cerebral networks
  are active in parallel and process information in an unconscious manner. An
  information becomes conscious, however, if the neural population that
  represents it is mobilized by top-down attentional amplification into a
  brain-scale state of coherent activity that involves many neurons distributed
  throughout the brain. The long-distance connectivity of these 'workspace
  neurons' can, when they are active for a minimal duration, make the
  information available to a variety of processes including perceptual
  categorization, long-term memorization, evaluation, and intentional action. We
  postulate that this global availability of information through the workspace
  is what we subjectively experience as a conscious state. A complete theory of
  consciousness should explain why some cognitive and cerebral representations
  can be permanently or temporarily inaccessible to consciousness, what is the
  range of possible conscious contents, how they map onto specific cerebral
  circuits, and whether a generic neuronal mechanism underlies all of them. We
  confront the workspace model with those issues and identify novel experimental
  predictions. Neurophysiological, anatomical, and brain-imaging data strongly
  argue for a major role of prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and the areas
  that connect to them, in creating the postulated brain-scale workspace.

  or a long time scale with small capacity - visual working memory. Recent
  research suggests that in addition, an intermediate stage of memory in between
  iconic memory and visual working memory exists. This intermediate stage has a
  large capacity and a lifetime of several seconds, but is easily overwritten by
  new stimulation. We therefore termed it fragile VSTM. In previous studies,
  fragile VSTM has been dissociated from iconic memory by the characteristics of
  the memory trace. In the present study, we dissociated fragile VSTM from
  visual working memory by showing a differentiation in their dependency on
  attention. A decrease in attention during presentation of the stimulus array
  greatly reduced the capacity of visual working memory, while this had only a
  small effect on the capacity of fragile VSTM. We conclude that fragile VSTM is
  a separate memory store from visual working memory. Thus, a tripartite
  division of VSTM appears to be in place, comprising iconic memory, fragile
  VSTM and visual working memory.},

  multiple goals are active and to guide behavior with information that is not

  and cognitive neuroscience data have converged on the idea that information is
  encoded into working memory by allocating attention to internal
  representations, whether semantic long-term memory (e.g., letters, digits,
  words), sensory, or motoric. Thus, information-based multivariate analyses of
  human functional MRI data typically find evidence for the temporary
  representation of stimuli in regions that also process this information in
  nonworking memory contexts. The prefrontal cortex (PFC), on the other hand,
  exerts control over behavior by biasing the salience of mnemonic
  representations and adjudicating among competing, context-dependent rules. The
  "control of the controller" emerges from a complex interplay between PFC and
  striatal circuits and ascending dopaminergic neuromodulatory signals.},

  abstract = {Short-term memory (STM) refers to the capacity-limited retention
  of information over a brief period of time, and working memory (WM) refers to
  the manipulation and use of that information to guide behavior. In recent
  years it has become apparent that STM and WM interact and overlap with other
  cognitive processes, including attention (the selection of a subset of
  information for further processing) and long-term memory (LTM-the encoding and
  retention of an effectively unlimited amount of information for a much longer
  period of time). Broadly speaking, there have been two classes of memory
  models: systems models, which posit distinct stores for STM and LTM (Atkinson
  and Shiffrin, 1968; Baddeley and Hitch, 1974); and state-based models, which
  posit a common store with different activation states corresponding to STM and
  LTM (Cowan, 1995; McElree, 1996; Oberauer, 2002). In this paper, we will focus
  on state-based accounts of STM. First, we will consider several theoretical
  models that postulate, based on considerable behavioral evidence, that
  information in STM can exist in multiple representational states. We will then
  consider how neural data from recent studies of STM can inform and constrain
  these theoretical models. In the process we will highlight the inferential
  advantage of multivariate, information-based analyses of neuroimaging data
  (fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG)) over conventional activation-based
  analysis approaches (Postle, in press). We will conclude by addressing
  lingering questions regarding the fractionation of STM, highlighting
  differences between the attention to information vs. the retention of
  information during brief memory delays.},

  that if the effect of an experimental manipulation is truly perceptual, then

  measure of response bias. Thus, if an experimental manipulation affects the
  measure of bias, but not d', then it is safe to conclude that the manipulation
  in question did not affect perception but instead affected the placement of
  the internal decision criterion. However, the opposite may be true: an effect
  on perception may affect measured bias while having no effect on d'. To
  illustrate this point, we expound how signal detection measures are calculated
  and show how all biases-including perceptual biases-can exert their effects on
  the criterion measure rather than on d'. While d' can provide evidence for a
  perceptual effect, an effect solely on the criterion measure can also arise
  from a perceptual effect. We further support this conclusion using simulations
  to demonstrate that the Müller-Lyer illusion, which is a classic visual
  illusion that creates a powerful perceptual effect on the apparent length of a
  line, influences the criterion measure without influencing d'. For
  discrimination experiments, SDT is effective at discriminating between
  sensitivity and bias but cannot by itself determine the underlying source of
  the bias, be it perceptual or response based.},

  abstract = {Consciousness has of late become a "hot topic" in neuroscience.
  Empirical work has centered on identifying potential neural correlates of
  consciousness (NCCs), with a converging view that the prefrontal parietal
  network (PPN) is closely associated with this process. Theoretical work has
  primarily sought to explain how informational properties of this cortical
  network could account for phenomenal properties of consciousness. However,
  both empirical and theoretical research has given less focus to the
  psychological features that may account for the NCCs. The PPN has also been
  heavily linked with cognitive processes, such as attention. We describe how
  this literature is under-appreciated in consciousness science, in part due to
  the increasingly entrenched assumption of a strong dissociation between
  attention and consciousness. We argue instead that there is more common ground
  between attention and consciousness than is usually emphasized: although
  objects can under certain circumstances be attended to in the absence of
  conscious access, attention as a content selection and boosting mechanism is
  an important and necessary aspect of consciousness. Like attention, working
  memory and executive control involve the interlinking of multiple mental
  objects and have also been closely associated with the PPN. We propose that
  this set of cognitive functions, in concert with attention, make up the core
  psychological components of consciousness. One related process, chunking,
  exploits logical or mnemonic redundancies in a dataset so that it can be
  recoded and a given task optimized. Chunking has been shown to activate PPN
  particularly robustly, even compared with other cognitively demanding tasks,
  such as working memory or mental arithmetic. It is therefore possible that
  chunking, as a tool to detect useful patterns within an integrated set of
  intensely processed (attended) information, has a central role to play in
  consciousness. Following on from this, we suggest that a key evolutionary
  purpose of consciousness may be to provide innovative solutions to complex or
  novel problems.},

  boost otherwise invisible objects into awareness. Here, we replicate these
  findings, but find that they reflect a general difference in detectability not
  specific to interocular suppression. To dissociate conscious and unconscious
  influences on visual detection effects, we use an additional discrimination
  task to rule out conscious processes as a cause for these differences. Results
  from this detection-discrimination dissociation paradigm reveal that, while
  face orientation is processed unconsciously, category-based attention requires
  awareness. These findings provide insights into the function of conscious
  perception and offer an experimental approach for mapping out the scope and

  across studies is a key feature of meta-analyses. This variability is
  reflected by measures like τ(2) or I(2), but their clinical interpretation is
  not straightforward. A prediction interval is less complicated: it presents
  the expected range of true effects in similar studies. We aimed to show the
  advantages of having the prediction interval routinely reported in
  meta-analyses. DESIGN: We show how the prediction interval can help understand
  the uncertainty about whether an intervention works or not. To evaluate the
  implications of using this interval to interpret the results, we selected the
  first meta-analysis per intervention review of the Cochrane Database of
  Systematic Reviews Issues 2009-2013 with a dichotomous (n=2009) or continuous
  (n=1254) outcome, and generated 95\% prediction intervals for them. RESULTS:
  In 72.4\% of 479 statistically significant (random-effects p0), the 95\%
  prediction interval suggested that the intervention effect could be null or
  even be in the opposite direction. In 20.3\% of those 479 meta-analyses, the
  prediction interval showed that the effect could be completely opposite to the
  point estimate of the meta-analysis. We demonstrate also how the prediction
  interval can be used to calculate the probability that a new trial will show a
  negative effect and to improve the calculations of the power of a new trial.
  CONCLUSIONS: The prediction interval reflects the variation in treatment
  effects over different settings, including what effect is to be expected in
  future patients, such as the patients that a clinician is interested to treat.
  Prediction intervals should be routinely reported to allow more informative
  inferences in meta-analyses.},

  Stan builds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data.
  Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book
  pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.
  This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the
  details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling
  work. The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel
  models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory
  and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to
  advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data,
  and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding. The
  second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal
  inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains
  new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered
  categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance
  sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an
  entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how
  domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.
  Features Integrates working code into the main text Illustrates concepts

  demonstrating that information may be stored for several seconds without any

  functional properties as conscious working memory? Here, we probe whether
  non-conscious working memory can maintain multiple items and their temporal
  order. In a visual masking task with a delayed response, 38 participants were
  asked to retain the location and order of presentation of two sequentially
  flashed spatial positions, and retrieve both after a 2.5 second delay. Even
  when subjective visibility was nil, subjects' objective forced-choice
  performance exceeded chance level and, crucially, distinct retrieval of the
  first and second location was observed on both conscious and non-conscious
  trials. Non-conscious working memory may therefore store two items in proper
  temporal order. These findings can be explained by recent models of
  activity-silent working memory.},

  consciousness have traditionally assigned a crucial role to the prefrontal
  cortex in generating consciousness as well as in orchestrating high-level
  conscious control over behavior. However, recent neuroscientific findings show
  that prefrontal cortex can be activated unconsciously. The depth, direction,
  and scope of these activations depend on several top-down factors such as the
  task being probed (task-set, strategy) and on (temporal/spatial) attention.
  Regardless, such activations-when mediated by feedforward activation only-do
  not lead to a conscious sensation. Although unconscious, these prefrontal
  activations are functional, in the sense that they are associated with
  behavioral effects of cognitive control, such as response inhibition, task
  switching, conflict monitoring, and error detection. These findings challenge
  the pivotal role of the prefrontal cortex in consciousness. Instead, it
  appears that specific brain areas (or cognitive modules) may support specific
  cognitive functions but that consciousness is independent of this. Conscious
  sensations arise only when the brain areas involved engage in recurrent
  interactions enabling the long-lasting exchange of information between brain
  regions. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that also the state of
  consciousness, for example, in vegetative state patients or during sleep and
  anesthesia, is closely related to the scope and extent of residual recurrent
  interactions among brain regions.},

  specified and very powerful system that could be criticized as little more
  than a homunculus. A research strategy is outlined that attempts to specify

  research. The first concerns the study of the capacity to coordinate
  performance on two separate tasks. A second involves the capacity to switch
  retrieval strategies as reflected in random generation. The capacity to attend
  selectively to one stimulus and inhibit the disrupting effect of others
  comprises the third line of research, and the fourth involves the capacity to
  hold and manipulate information in long-term memory, as reflected in measures
  of working memory span. It is suggested that this multifaceted approach is a
  fruitful one that leaves open the question of whether it will ultimately prove
  more appropriate to regard the executive as a unified system with multiple
  functions, or simply as an agglomeration of independent though interacting
  control processes. In the meantime, it seems useful to continue to use the
  concept of a central executive as a reminder of the crucially important

  little effort has been made to compare them systematically. Yet, such a

  processing inferred from these two techniques must be reconciled, as our
  understanding of unconscious vision should be independent of the technique
  used to prevent visibility. Here, we studied similarities and differences
  between faces rendered invisible by masking vs. interocular suppression using
  a priming paradigm. By carefully equating stimulus strength across the two
  techniques, we analyzed the effects of face primes with the same viewpoint
  (repetition priming, Experiment 1) and of face primes with a different
  viewpoint (identity priming, Experiment 2) on the reaction times for a fame
  categorization task. Overall, we found that the magnitude of both repetition
  and identity priming largely depended on stimulus visibility. Moreover, when
  the primes were subjectively invisible, both repetition and identity priming
  were found to be qualitatively stronger under masking than under interocular
  suppression. Taken together, these results help refine our understanding of
  which level of visual processing each technique disrupts, and illustrate the

  response-bias free measure of how well confidence ratings track task accuracy.
  Here we provide an overview of standard SDT and an extended formal treatment
  of meta-d′. However, whereas meta-d′ characterizes an observer’s sensitivity
  in tracking overall accuracy, it may sometimes be of interest to assess
  metacognition for a particular kind of behavioral response. For instance, in a
  perceptual detection task, we may wish to characterize metacognition
  separately for reports of stimulus presence and absence. Here we discuss the
  methodology for computing such a “response-specific” meta-d′ and provide
  corresponding Matlab code. This approach potentially offers an alternative
  explanation for data that are typically taken to support the unequal variance
  SDT (UV-SDT) model. We demonstrate that simulated data generated from UV-SDT
  can be well fit by an equal variance SDT model positing different
  metacognitive ability for each kind of behavioral response, and likewise that
  data generated by the latter model can be captured by UV-SDT. This ambiguity
  entails that caution is needed in interpreting the processes underlying
  relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve properties. Type 1 ROC curves
  generated by combining type 1 and type 2 judgments, traditionally interpreted
  in terms of low-level processes (UV), can potentially be interpreted in terms
  of high-level processes instead (response-specific metacognition). Similarly,
  differences in area under response-specific type 2 ROC curves may reflect the
  influence of low-level processes (UV) rather than high-level metacognitive

  abstract = {A critical question, fundamental for building models of emotion,
  is how to categorize emotions. Previous studies have typically taken one of
  two approaches: (a) they focused on the pre-perceptual visual cues, how
  salient facial features or configurations were displayed; or (b) they focused
  on the post-perceptual affective experiences, how emotions affected behavior.
  In this study, we attempted to group emotions at a peri-perceptual processing
  level: it is well known that humans perceive different facial expressions
  differently, therefore, can we classify facial expressions into distinct
  categories in terms of their perceptual similarities? Here, using a novel
  non-lexical paradigm, we assessed the perceptual dissimilarities between 20
  facial expressions using reaction times. Multidimensional-scaling analysis
  revealed that facial expressions were organized predominantly along the
  upper-lower face axis. Cluster analysis of behavioral data delineated three
  superordinate categories, and eye-tracking measurements validated these
  clustering results. Interestingly, these superordinate categories can be
  conceptualized according to how facial displays interact with acoustic
  communications: One group comprises expressions that have salient mouth
  features. They likely link to species-specific vocalization, for example,
  crying, laughing. The second group comprises visual displays with diagnosing
  features in both the mouth and the eye regions. They are not directly
  articulable but can be expressed prosodically, for example, sad, angry.
  Expressions in the third group are also whole-face expressions but are
  completely independent of vocalization, and likely being blends of two or more
  elementary expressions. We propose a theoretical framework to interpret the
  tripartite division in which distinct expression subsets are interpreted as
  successive phases in an evolutionary chain. © 2021, The Psychonomic Society,

  in recent years, the precise mechanisms that support consciousness remain
  elusive. Examining the neural correlates associated with the moment a stimulus
  enters or exits conscious awareness is one way to potentially identify the
  neural mechanisms that give rise to consciousness. In the present study, we
  recorded neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants
  observed a bilateral shape-from-motion (SFM) display. While the display is in
  motion, the observer perceives an object that is immediately segregated from a
  noisy background. After the motion stops, the observer's experience of the
  object remains momentarily in awareness, before it eventually fades out of
  consciousness back into the noisy background. Consistent with subjective
  reports of perceptual experience, we observed a prominent sustained posterior
  contralateral negativity known as the contralateral delay activity (CDA). This
  activity was sustained only in conditions associated with sustained awareness.
  Interestingly, the amplitude of the CDA was correlated with individual
  differences in visual awareness, suggesting that this activity plays a
  significant role in the maintenance of objects in consciousness. The CDA is
  typically associated with visual short-term memory (VSTM), suggesting that
  conscious visual awareness may be mediated by the same neural and cognitive
  mechanisms that support VSTM. Our results demonstrate that the CDA may reflect

  taskrelevant items in M1. Critically, the CDA switched polarity when M2
  displays appeared on the opposite side. In line with the attentional
  activation account, these reversed CDA components exclusively reflected the
  number of items that were encoded from M2 displays, irrespective of how many
  M1 items were already held in working memory. On trials where M1 and M2
  displays were presented on the same side and on trials where M2 displays
  appeared nonlaterally, CDA components elicited in the interval after M2
  remained sensitive to a residual trace of M1 items, indicating that some
  activation of previously stored items was maintained across encoding episodes.

  2003–2020, 2016] proposed the alternative hypothesis that the CDA tracks the
  current focus of spatial attention instead of WM storage. This hypothesis was
  based on the finding that, when two successive arrays of memoranda were placed
  in opposite hemi-fields, CDA amplitude was primarily determined by the
  position and number of items in the second display, not the total memory load
  across both displays. Here, we considered the alternative interpretation that
  participants dropped the first array from WM when they encoded the second
  array because the format of the probe display was spatially incompatible with
  the initial sample display. In this case, even if the CDA indexes active
  storage rather than spatial attention, CDA activity would be determined by the
  second array. We tested this idea by directly manipulating the spatial
  compatibility of sample and probe displays. With spatially incompatible
  displays, we replicated Berggren and Eimer’s findings. However, with spatially
  compatible displays, we found clear evidence that CDA activity tracked the
  full storage load across both arrays, in line with a WM storage account of CDA
  activity. We propose that expectations of display compatibility influenced
  whether participants viewed the arrays as parts of a single extended event or
  two independent episodes. Thus, these findings raise interesting new questions

  abstract = {A minimal hypothesis is proposed concerning the brain processes
  underlying effortful tasks. It distinguishes two main computational spaces: a
  unique global workspace composed of distributed and heavily interconnected
  neurons with long-range axons, and a set of specialized and modular
  perceptual, motor, memory, evaluative, and attentional processors. Workspace
  neurons are mobilized in effortful tasks for which the specialized processors
  do not suffice. They selectively mobilize or suppress, through descending
  connections, the contribution of specific processor neurons. In the course of
  task performance, workspace neurons become spontaneously coactivated, forming
  discrete though variable spatio-temporal patterns subject to modulation by
  vigilance signals and to selection by reward signals. A computer simulation of
  the Stroop task shows workspace activation to increase during acquisition of a
  novel task, effortful execution, and after errors. We outline predictions for
  spatio-temporal activation patterns during brain imaging, particularly about
  the contribution of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate to
  the workspace.},

  abstract = {It is widely assumed that the short-term retention of information
  is accomplished via maintenance of an active neural trace. However, we
  demonstrate that memory can be preserved across a brief delay despite the
  apparent loss of sustained representations. Delay period activity may, in
  fact, reflect the focus of attention, rather than STM. We unconfounded
  attention and memory by causing external and internal shifts of attention away
  from items that were being actively retained. Multivariate pattern analysis of
  fMRI indicated that only items within the focus of attention elicited an
  active neural trace. Activity corresponding to representations of items
  outside the focus quickly dropped to baseline. Nevertheless, this information
  was remembered after a brief delay. Our data also show that refocusing
  attention toward a previously unattended memory item can reactivate its neural
  signature. The loss of sustained activity has long been thought to indicate a
  disruption of STM, but our results suggest that, even for small memory loads
  not exceeding the capacity limits of STM, the active maintenance of a stimulus
  representation may not be necessary for its short-term retention.},

  abstract = {There has been recent interest in the neural correlates of visual
  short-term memory (VSTM) interference by irrelevant perceptual input. These
  studies, however, presented distracters that were subjected to conscious
  scrutiny by participants thus strongly involving attentional control
  mechanisms. In order to minimize the role of attentional control and to
  investigate interference occurring at the level of sensory representations, we
  developed a paradigm in which a subliminal visual distracter is presented
  during the delay period of a visual short-term memory task requiring the
  maintenance of stimulus orientation. This subliminal distracter could be
  either congruent or incongruent with the orientation of the memory item.
  Behavioral results showed that the intervening distracter affected the
  fidelity of VSTM when it was incongruent with the memory cue. We then assessed
  the causal role of the early visual cortex in this interaction by using
  transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We found that occipital TMS impaired
  the fidelity VSTM content in the absence of the memory mask. Interestingly,
  TMS facilitated VSTM performance in the presence of a subliminal memory mask
  that was incongruent with the memory content. Signal detection analyses
  indicated that TMS did not modulate perceptual sensitivity of the masked
  distracter. That the impact of TMS on the precision of VSTM was dissociated by
  the presence vs. absence of a subliminal perceptual distracter and its
  congruency with the VSTM content provides causal evidence for the view that
  competitive interactions between memory and perception can occur at the
  earliest cortical stages of visual processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

  different types of information and to maintain or manipulate them promotes the
  flow of ongoing tasks. WM is a key component of normal human cognition. In
  this study, we applied a combined voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and
  resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis to investigate the
  relationship between the ability of object and spatial working memory (WM),
  and regional gray matter density (GMD), as well as intrinsic functional
  connectivity. The VBM analysis showed a positive correlation between the
  individual difference of object WM and GMD in the right middle occipital gyrus
  (MOG) and the left superior temporal gyrus (STG), which are responsible for
  coding object information and processing the shape of an object. The
  individual difference of the spatial WM was positively related to GMD in the
  right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) located in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
  (dlPFC), which confirmed that it is an important region for memory stores and
  maintains WM spatial representations. Further functional connectivity analysis
  revealed that the individual difference of object WM was significantly
  correlated with the rsFC of right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) - left
  postcentral gyrus (PostCG)/right precentral gyrus (PreCG)/left Supplementary
  Motor Area (SMA). While the capacity of spatial WM was significantly
  associated with the FC strength of the left dlPFC - left precuneus, right
  dlPFC - right MFG, and the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS) - left SMA/
  right inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Our findings suggest that object WM is
  associated with the structure and functional organization of the brain regions
  involved in the ventral pathway (occipital - temporal regions) and the
  capacity of spatial WM is related to the dorsal pathway (frontal - parietal
  regions).},

  human amygdala. Such increases are particularly evident for expressions that
  convey potential threat to the observer, and arise even when the face is
  masked from awareness. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
  examine whether the amygdala responds differentially to threatening (fearful)
  versus nonthreatening (happy) facial expressions depending on whether the face
  is attended or actively ignored. In separate runs, participants were cued to
  attend to a face or a house within semitransparent, spatially overlaid
  composite pairs, presented either side of fixation, and were required to
  perform a demanding same/different judgment. We found significant attentional
  modulation of activity in category-specific 'face' (fusiform gyrus) and
  'place' (parahippocampal gyrus) regions, with activity in each area increasing
  selectively when its preferred stimulus was attended versus ignored. In
  contrast, activity in the amygdala differed according to the valence of the
  facial expression and the category of the attended stimulus. For happy faces,
  activity in the amygdala was greater in the attend-face than in the
  attend-house condition, whereas for fearful faces, activity was greater in the
  attend-house than in the attend-face condition. We conclude that differential
  amygdala responses to fearful versus happy facial expressions are tuned by
  mechanisms of attention and that the amygdala gives preference to potentially
  threatening stimuli under conditions of inattention.},

  can be performed in a non-conscious mode, but that conscious perception is
  characterized by an amplification, global propagation and integration of brain
  signals. A comparison of these data with major theoretical proposals suggests
  that firstly, conscious access must be carefully distinguished from selective
  attention; secondly, conscious perception may be likened to a non-linear
  decision that 'ignites' a network of distributed areas; thirdly, information
  which is selected for conscious perception gains access to additional
  computations, including temporary maintenance, global sharing, and flexible
  routing; and finally, measures of the complexity, long-distance correlation
  and integration of brain signals provide reliable indices of conscious
  processing, clinically relevant to patients recovering from coma.},

  We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric

  effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic
  inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the
  opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same
  problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in
  factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that
  averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even
  ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation
  of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that
  there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal
  values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or
  similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although
  frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use
  Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their
  richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is
  provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric
  models.},

  address it are grounded in the notion that science is a binary signal
  detection problem. However, contrary to null hypothesis significance testing
  (NHST) logic, the magnitude of the underlying effect size for a given
  experiment is best conceptualized as a random draw from a continuous
  distribution, not as a random draw from a dichotomous distribution (null vs.
  alternative). Moreover, because continuously distributed effects selected
  using a P < 0.05 filter must be inflated, the fact that they are smaller when
  replicated (reflecting regression to the mean) is no reason to sound the
  alarm. Considered from this perspective, recent replication efforts suggest
  that most published P < 0.05 scientific findings are "true" (i.e., in the
  correct direction), with observed effect sizes that are inflated to varying
  degrees. We propose that original science is a screening process, one that
  adopts NHST logic as a useful fiction for selecting true effects that are
  potentially large enough to be of interest to other scientists. Unlike
  original science, replication science seeks to precisely measure the
  underlying effect size associated with an experimental protocol via large-N
  direct replication, without regard for statistical significance. Registered
  reports are well suited to (often resource-intensive) direct replications,
  which should focus on influential findings and be published regardless of
  outcome. Conceptual replications play an important but separate role in
  validating theories. However, because they are part of NHST-based original
  science, conceptual replications cannot serve as the field's self-correction
  mechanism. Only direct replications can do that.},

  abstract = {In psychophysics, researchers usually apply a two-level model for
  the analysis of the behavior of the single subject and the population. This
  classical model has two main disadvantages. First, the second level of the
  analysis discards information on trial repetitions and subject-specific
  variability. Second, the model does not easily allow assessing the goodness of
  fit. As an alternative to this classical approach, here we propose the
  Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The GLMM separately estimates the
  variability of fixed and random effects, it has a higher statistical power,
  and it allows an easier assessment of the goodness of fit compared with the
  classical two-level model. GLMMs have been frequently used in many disciplines
  since the 1990s; however, they have been rarely applied in psychophysics.
  Furthermore, to our knowledge, the issue of estimating the
  point-of-subjective-equivalence (PSE) within the GLMM framework has never been
  addressed. Therefore the article has two purposes: It provides a brief
  introduction to the usage of the GLMM in psychophysics, and it evaluates two
  different methods to estimate the PSE and its variability within the GLMM
  framework. We compare the performance of the GLMM and the classical two-level
  model on published experimental data and simulated data. We report that the
  estimated values of the parameters were similar between the two models and
  Type I errors were below the confidence level in both models. However, the
  GLMM has a higher statistical power than the two-level model. Moreover, one
  can easily compare the fit of different GLMMs according to different criteria.
  In conclusion, we argue that the GLMM can be a useful method in psychophysics.},

  moderated by an interaction between age of second language acquisition (AoA)

  abstract = {There is heterogeneity in and a lack of consensus on the preferred
  statistical analyses in light of a multitude of potentially equally
  justifiable approaches. Here, we introduce multiverse analysis for the field
  of experimental psychopathology research. We present a model multiverse
  approach tailored to fear conditioning research and, as a secondary aim,
  introduce the R package 'multifear' that allows to run all the models though a
  single line of code. Model specifications and data reduction approaches were
  identified through a systematic literature search. The heterogeneity of
  statistical models identified included Bayesian ANOVA and t-tests as well as
  frequentist ANOVA, t-test as well as mixed models with a variety of data
  reduction approaches. We illustrate the power of a multiverse analysis for
  fear conditioning data based on two pre-existing data sets with partial (data
  set 1) and 100\% reinforcement rate (data set 2) by using CS discrimination in
  skin conductance responses (SCRs) during fear acquisition and extinction
  training as case examples. Both the effect size and the direction of effect
  was impacted by choice of the model and data reduction techniques. We
  anticipate that an increase in multiverse-type of studies will aid the
  development of formal theories through the accumulation of empirical evidence
  and ultimately aid clinical translation.},

  abstract = {An important 2019 paper applied a novel analytic technique called
  Specification Curve Analysis (SCA) to data from three large-scale community
  samples to investigate the association between adolescent technology use and
  mental health/well-being. The paper concluded that an association exists but
  is tiny, with median betas between -0.01 and -0.04. This association was
  reported to be smaller than links between mental health and various innocuous
  variables in the datasets such as eating potatoes, and therefore to be of no
  practical significance. The current paper re-ran SCA on the same datasets
  while applying alternative analytic constraints on the model specification
  space, including: 1) examining specific digital media activities (e.g., social
  media) separately rather than lumping all "screen time" including TV together;
  2) examining boys and girls separately, rather than examining them together;
  3) excluding potential mediators from the list of controls; and 4) treating
  scales equally (rather than allowing one scale with many subscales to dominate
  all others). We were able to reproduce the original results with the original
  configurations. When we used the revised constraints, we found several much
  larger relationships than previously reported. In particular: among girls,
  there is a consistent and substantial association between mental health and
  social media use (median betas from -0.11 to -0.24). These associations were
  stronger than links between mental health and binge drinking, sexual assault,
  obesity, and hard drug use, suggesting that these associations may have
  substantial practical significance as many countries are experiencing rising
  rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide among teenagers and young adults.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to conduct a particularly
  stringent pre-registered in-vestigation of the claim that there exists a level
  of linguistic representation that “includes syntactic category information but
  not semantic information” (Branigan \& Pickering, 2017: 8). As a test case, we
  focussed on the English passive; a construction for which previous findings
  have been somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, several studies using
  different methodologies have found an advantage for theme-experiencer passives
  (e.g., The girl was shocked by the tiger; and also agent-patient passives;
  e.g., The girl was hit by the tiger) over experiencer-theme passives (e.g.,
  The girl was ignored by the tiger). On the other hand, Messenger et al. (2012)
  found no evidence that theme-experiencer and experiencer-theme passives vary
  in their propensity to prime production of agent-patient passives. We
  therefore conducted an online replication of Messen-ger et al (2012) with a
  pre-registered appropriately powered sample (N=240). Although a large and
  significant priming effect (i.e., an effect of prime sentence type) was
  ob-served, a Bayesian analysis yielded only weak/anecdotal evidence (BF=2.11)
  for the crucial interaction of verb type by prime type; a finding that was
  robust to different coding and exclusion decisions, operationalizations of
  verb semantics (dichoto-mous/continuous), analysis frameworks
  (Bayesian/frequentist) and - as per a mixed-effects-multiverse analyses -
  random effects structures. Nevertheless, these findings do no not provide
  evidence for the absence of semantic effects (as has been argued for the
  findings of Messenger et al, 2012). We conclude that these and related
  findings are best explained by a model that includes both lexical,
  exemplar-level representations and rep-resentations at multiple higher levels
  of abstraction. © 2022 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All

  abstract = {The amygdala and its connections with medial prefrontal cortex
  (mPFC) play central roles in the development of emotional processes. While
  several studies have suggested that this circuitry exhibits functional changes
  across the first two decades of life, findings have been mixed - perhaps
  resulting from differences in analytic choices across studies. Here we used
  multiverse analyses to examine the robustness of task-based amygdala-mPFC
  function findings to analytic choices within the context of an accelerated
  longitudinal design (4-22 years-old; N = 98; 183 scans; 1-3
  scans/participant). Participants recruited from the greater Los Angeles area
  completed an event-related emotional face (fear, neutral) task. Parallel
  analyses varying in preprocessing and modeling choices found that age-related
  change estimates for amygdala reactivity were more robust than task-evoked
  amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity to varied analytical choices.
  Specification curves indicated evidence for age-related decreases in amygdala
  reactivity to faces, though within-participant changes in amygdala reactivity
  could not be differentiated from between-participant differences. In contrast,
  amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity results varied across methods much more,
  and evidence for age-related change in amygdala-mPFC connectivity was not
  consistent. Generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) measurements of
  connectivity were especially sensitive to whether a deconvolution step was
  applied. Our findings demonstrate the importance of assessing the robustness
  of findings to analysis choices, although the age-related changes in our
  current work cannot be overinterpreted given low test-retest reliability.
  Together, these findings highlight both the challenges in estimating
  developmental change in longitudinal cohorts and the value of multiverse
  approaches in developmental neuroimaging for assessing robustness of results.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Large-scale panel data suggest that older people tend
  to be less neurotic, extraverted and open-minded, but more agreeable and
  conscientious. In this study, the relationships between age and the Big Five
  dimensions were examined for 324 German psychotherapists. Methods: A model
  uncertainty and robustness approach was applied to evaluate the stability of
  relationships between age and the Big Five measures across a multiverse of
  regression analyses when controlling for job experience, gender,
  psychotherapeutic orientation, and occupational demands. Results: Older
  psychotherapists were found to be more open and less neurotic, and
  conscientious. Relationships were found to be linear and were not moderated by
  occupational demands. Conclusions: The observed relationships between age and
  psychotherapists' personality are discussed in consideration of social
  investment theories and a close connection between personal and professional
  development as a distinct feature of psychotherapeutic work. Those patterns
  parallel clients' preferences and likely contribute to therapy outcomes, which
  should be addressed in future studies in psychotherapy research. © 2022

  characteristic-outcome associations have not taken a principled approach to
  covariate use or other sampling strategies to ensure the robustness of

  personality characteristics are associated with important outcomes after

  outcomes across eight different person- and study-level moderators using
  individual participant data from 171,395 individuals across 10 longitudinal
  panel studies in a mega-analytic framework. Robustness and boundary conditions
  were systematically tested using two approaches: propensity score matching and
  specification curve analysis. Three findings emerged: First, personality
  characteristics remain robustly associated with later life outcomes. Second,
  the effects generalize, as there are few moderators of personality- outcome
  associations. Third, robustness was differential across covariate choice in
  nearly half of the tested models, with the inclusion or exclusion of some of
  these flipping the direction of association. In summary, personality
  characteristics are robustly associated with later life outcomes with few
  moderated associations. However, researchers still need to be careful in their
  choices of covariates. We discuss how these findings can inform studies of

  abstract = {Educational materials focused on spatial data analysis often
  feature mathematical descriptions of methods and step-by-step instructions of
  software tools, but infrequently discuss the set of decisions involved in
  specifying a statistical model. Failing to consider model specification may
  lead to specification searching, or the process of repeating analyses to
  obtain results that meet the criteria thought to be required for publication,
  and the disproportionate reporting of false-positive results in the academic
  literature. This article proposes that the specification curve–a
  meta-analytical technique that visualizes the specifications and results from
  a large set of justifiable and plausible statistical models–be used as a
  pedagogical tool to teach (spatial) data analysis and explore the geographic
  uncertainties that arise when specifying and interpreting spatial regression
  models. An example specification curve that focuses on two common
  specification decisions in a spatial regression model, specifically selecting
  predictor variables and constructing the spatial weight matrix, is
  illustrated. Strategies for using the specification curve in educational
  contexts to develop analytical plans, reflect on the generalizability of
  research findings, and highlight issues of replicability and publication bias
  are proposed. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {In studies of event-related brain potentials (ERPs), numerous
  decisions about data processing are required to extract ERP scores from
  continuous data. Unfortunately, the systematic impact of these choices on the
  data quality and psychometric reliability of ERP scores or even ERP scores
  themselves is virtually unknown, which is a barrier to the standardization of
  ERPs. The aim of the present study was to optimize processing pipelines for
  the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) by considering a
  multiverse of data processing choices. A multiverse analysis of a data
  processing pipeline examines the impact of a large set of different reasonable
  choices to determine the robustness of effects, such as the impact of
  different decisions on between-trial standard deviations (i.e., data quality)
  and between-condition differences (i.e., experimental effects). ERN and Pe
  data from 298 healthy young adults were used to determine the impact of
  different methodological choices on data quality and experimental effects
  (correct vs. error trials) at several key stages: highpass filtering, lowpass
  filtering, ocular artifact correction, reference, baseline adjustment, scoring
  sensors, and measurement procedure. This multiverse analysis yielded 3,456 ERN
  scores and 576 Pe scores per person. An optimized pipeline for ERN included a
  15 Hz lowpass filter, ICA-based ocular artifact correction, and a region of
  interest (ROI) approach to scoring. For Pe, the optimized pipeline included a
  0.10 Hz highpass filter, 30 Hz lowpass filter, regression-based ocular
  artifact correction, a -200 to 0 ms baseline adjustment window, and an ROI
  approach to scoring. The multiverse approach can be used to optimize pipelines
  for eventual standardization, which would support efforts toward establishing
  normative ERP databases. The proposed process of analyzing the data-processing
  multiverse of ERP scores paves the way for better refinement, identification,
  and selection of data processing parameters, ultimately improving the
  precision and utility of ERPs.},

  abstract = {The questions of whether high-income individuals are more
  prosocial than low-income individuals and whether income inequality moderates
  this effect have received extensive attention. We shed new light on this topic
  by analyzing a large-scale dataset with rfaut representative sample of
  respondents from 133 countries (N = 948,837). We conduct a multiverse analysis
  with 30 statistical models: 15 models predicting the likelihood of donating
  money to charity and 15 models predicting the likelihood of volunteering time
  to an organization. Across all model specifications, high-income individuals
  were more likely to donate their money and volunteer their time than
  low-income individuals. High-income individuals were more likely to engage in
  prosocial behavior under high (vs. low) income inequality. Avenues for future
  research and potential mechanisms are discussed. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing

  abstract = {Personality traits describe how people typically think, feel, and
  behave. Personality states describe how people think, feel, and behave in a
  given moment. In their daily lives, people often behave the way they typically
  do (they enact trait-congruent personality states), but occasionally behave
  differently from how they typically do (trait-incongruent personality states).
  Several theories propose that such incongruent personality states should be
  associated with undesirable outcomes such as less positive affect or more
  tiredness, but the current state of evidence is inconclusive and mostly based
  on one personality dimension: extraversion. In this study, we contribute to
  filling important gaps in the literature by examining congruence of
  personality dimensions other than extraversion, considering characteristics of
  the situation, and modeling congruence with state-of-the-art response surface
  analyses. We aimed to manipulate state honesty-humility and state
  agreeableness as well as perceived adversity and deception of the situation in
  a prisoner's dilemma paradigm. The manipulations mostly had the intended
  effects but they also had additional unspecific effects on other personality
  states and situation characteristics. The study thus emphasized the difficulty
  of manipulating personality states, situation characteristics, and trait-state
  and state-situation congruence. In pre-registered analyses of variance,
  response surface analyses, and specification curve analyses, we then examined
  how trait-state congruence and state-situation congruence were associated with
  positive affect, tiredness, and performance in a numerical Stroop task.
  Neither trait-state congruence nor state-situation congruence were associated
  with positive affect, tiredness, or cognitive performance. However, in light
  of this study's limitations, more studies that are carefully designed,
  carefully operationalized, and well-powered are needed to examine trait-state
  and state-situation congruence. Because experimental research can advance the
  understanding of personality dynamics substantially, future research should
  additionally further aim to develop valid and reliable manipulations of
  personality states and situation characteristics. © This is an open-access

  abstract = {Adverse effects following acute stress are traditionally thought
  to reflect functional impairments of central executive-dependent
  cognitive-control processes. However, recent evidence demonstrates that
  cognitive-control application is perceived as effortful and aversive,
  indicating that stress-related decrements in cognitive performance could
  denote decreased motivation to expend effort instead. To investigate this
  hypothesis, we tested 40 young, healthy individuals (20 female, 20 male) under
  both stress and control conditions in a 2-day study that had a within-subjects
  design. Cognitive-effort avoidance was assessed using the demand-selection
  task, in which participants chose between performing low-demand and
  high-demand variants of a task-switching paradigm. We found that acute stress
  indeed increased participants' preference for less demanding behavior, whereas
  task-switching performance remained intact. Additional Bayesian and multiverse
  analyses confirmed the robustness of this effect. Our findings provide novel
  insights into how stressful experiences shape behavior by modulating our
  motivation to employ cognitive control.},

  abstract = {In this crowdsourced initiative, independent analysts used the
  same dataset to test two hypotheses regarding the effects of scientists’
  gender and professional status on verbosity during group meetings. Not only
  the analytic approach but also the operationalizations of key variables were
  left unconstrained and up to individual analysts. For instance, analysts could
  choose to operationalize status as job title, institutional ranking, citation
  counts, or some combination. To maximize transparency regarding the process by
  which analytic choices are made, the analysts used a platform we developed
  called DataExplained to justify both preferred and rejected analytic paths in
  real time. Analyses lacking sufficient detail, reproducible code, or with
  statistical errors were excluded, resulting in 29 analyses in the final
  sample. Researchers reported radically different analyses and dispersed
  empirical outcomes, in a number of cases obtaining significant effects in
  opposite directions for the same research question. A Boba multiverse analysis
  demonstrates that decisions about how to operationalize variables explain
  variability in outcomes above and beyond statistical choices (e.g.,
  covariates). Subjective researcher decisions play a critical role in driving
  the reported empirical results, underscoring the need for open data,
  systematic robustness checks, and transparency regarding both analytic paths
  taken and not taken. Implications for organizations and leaders, whose
  decision making relies in part on scientific findings, consulting reports, and
  internal analyses by data scientists, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Research using eye tracking methods has revealed that when viewing
  faces, between 6 to 10 months of age, infants begin to shift visual attention
  from the eye region to the mouth region. Moreover, this shift varies with
  stimulus characteristics and infants' experience with faces and languages. The
  current study examined the eye movements of a racially diverse sample of 98
  infants between 7.5 and 10.5 months of age as they viewed movies of White and
  Asian American women reciting a nursery rhyme (the auditory component of the
  movies was replaced with music to eliminate the influence of the speech on
  infants' looking behavior). Using an analytic approach inspired by the
  multiverse analysis approach, several measures from infants' eye gaze were
  examined to identify patterns that were robust across different analyses.
  Although in general infants preferred the lower regions of the faces, i.e.,
  the region containing the mouth, this preference depended on the stimulus
  characteristics and was stronger for infants whose typical experience included
  faces of more races and for infants who were exposed to multiple languages.
  These results show how we can leverage the richness of eye tracking data with
  infants to add to our understanding of the factors that influence infants'
  visual exploration of faces.},

  abstract = {Multiverse analysis is an approach to data analysis in which all
  "reasonable" analytic decisions are evaluated in parallel and interpreted
  collectively, in order to foster robustness and transparency. However,
  specifying a multiverse is demanding because analysts must manage myriad
  variants from a cross-product of analytic decisions, and the results require
  nuanced interpretation. We contribute Baba: an integrated domain-specific
  language (DSL) and visual analysis system for authoring and reviewing
  multiverse analyses. With the Boba DSL, analysts write the shared portion of
  analysis code only once, alongside local variations defining alternative
  decisions, from which the compiler generates a multiplex of scripts
  representing all possible analysis paths. The Boba Visualizer provides linked
  views of model results and the multiverse decision space to enable rapid,
  systematic assessment of consequential decisions and robustness, including
  sampling uncertainty and model fit. We demonstrate Boba's utility through two
  data analysis case studies, and reflect on challenges and design opportunities
  for multiverse analysis software.},

  abstract = {People's risk preferences are thought to be central to many
  consequential real-life decisions, making it important to identify robust
  correlates of this construct. Various psychological theories have put forth a
  series of candidate correlates, yet the strength and robustness of their
  associations remain unclear because of disparate operationalizations of risk
  preference and analytic limitations in past research. We addressed these
  issues with a study involving several operationalizations of risk preference
  (all collected from each participant in a diverse sample of the German
  population; N = 916), and by adopting an exhaustive modeling
  approach-specification curve analysis. Our analyses of 6 candidate correlates
  (household income, sex, age, fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence,
  years of education) suggest that sex and age have robust and consistent
  associations with risk preference, whereas the other candidate correlates show
  weaker and more (domain-) specific associations (except for crystallized
  intelligence, for which there were no robust associations). The results
  further demonstrate the important role of construct operationalization when
  assessing people's risk preferences: Self-reported propensity measures picked
  up various associations with the proposed correlates, but (incentivized)
  behavioral measures largely failed to do so. In short, the associations
  between the 6 candidate correlates and risk preference depend mostly on how
  risk preference is measured, rather than whether and which control variables
  are included in the model specifications. The present findings inform several
  theories that have suggested candidate correlates of risk preference, and
  illustrate how personality research may profit from exhaustive modeling
  techniques to improve theory and measurement of essential constructs.

  abstract = {Decisions made by researchers while analyzing data (e.g., how to
  measure variables, how to handle outliers) are sometimes arbitrary, without an
  objective justification for choosing one alternative over another.
  Multiverse-style methods (e.g., specification curve, vibration of effects)
  estimate an effect across an entire set of possible specifications to expose
  the impact of hidden degrees of freedom and/or obtain robust, less biased
  estimates of the effect of interest. However, if specifications are not truly
  arbitrary, multiverse-style analyses can produce misleading results,
  potentially hiding meaningful effects within a mass of poorly justified
  alternatives. So far, a key question has received scant attention: How does
  one decide whether alternatives are arbitrary? We offer a framework and
  conceptual tools for doing so. We discuss three kinds of a priori
  nonequivalence among alternatives—measurement nonequivalence, effect
  nonequivalence, and power/precision nonequivalence. The criteria we review
  lead to three decision scenarios: Type E decisions (principled equivalence),
  Type N decisions (principled nonequivalence), and Type U decisions
  (uncertainty). In uncertain scenarios, multiverse-style analysis should be
  conducted in a deliberately exploratory fashion. The framework is discussed
  with reference to published examples and illustrated with the help of a
  simulated data set. Our framework will help researchers reap the benefits of
  multiverse-style methods while avoiding their pitfalls. © The Author(s) 2021.},

  abstract = {When analyzing data, researchers may have multiple reasonable
  options for the many decisions they must make about the data-for example, how
  to code a variable or which participants to exclude. Therefore, there exists a
  multiverse of possible data sets. A classic multiverse analysis involves
  performing a given analysis on every potential data set in this multiverse to
  examine how each data decision affects the results. However, a limitation of
  the multiverse analysis is that it addresses only data cleaning and analytic
  decisions, yet researcher decisions that affect results also happen at the
  data-collection stage. I propose an adaptation of the multiverse method in
  which the multiverse of data sets is composed of real data sets from studies
  varying in data-collection methods of interest. I walk through an example
  analysis applying the approach to 19 studies on shooting decisions to
  demonstrate the usefulness of this approach and conclude with a further
  discussion of the limitations and applications of this method.},

  abstract = {The worst performance rule (WPR) is a robust empirical finding
  reflecting that people's worst task performance shows numerically stronger
  correlations with cognitive ability than their average or best performance.
  However, recent meta-analytic work has proposed this be renamed the "not-best
  performance" rule because mean and worst performance seem to predict cognitive
  ability to similar degrees, with both predicting ability better than best
  performance. We re-analyzed data from a previously published latent-variable
  study to test for worst vs. not-best performance across a variety of reaction
  time tasks in relation to two cognitive ability constructs: working memory
  capacity (WMC) and propensity for task-unrelated thought (TUT). Using two
  methods of assessing worst performance-ranked-binning and ex-Gaussian-modeling
  approaches-we found evidence for both the worst and not-best performance
  rules. WMC followed the not-best performance rule (correlating equivalently
  with mean and longest response times (RTs)) but TUT propensity followed the
  worst performance rule (correlating more strongly with longest RTs).
  Additionally, we created a mini-multiverse following different outlier
  exclusion rules to test the robustness of our findings; our findings remained
  stable across the different multiverse iterations. We provisionally conclude
  that the worst performance rule may only arise in relation to cognitive
  abilities closely linked to (failures of) sustained attention.},

  abstract = {The sustaining environments hypothesis refers to the popular idea,
  stemming from theories in developmental, cognitive, and educational
  psychology, that the long-term success of early educational interventions is
  contingent on the quality of the subsequent learning environment. Several
  studies have investigated whether specific kindergarten classroom and other
  elementary school factors account for patterns of persistence and fadeout of
  early educational interventions. These analyses focus on the statistical
  interaction between an early educational intervention – usually whether the
  child attended preschool – and several measures of the quality of the
  subsequent educational environment. The key prediction of the sustaining
  environments hypothesis is a positive interaction between these two variables.
  To quantify the strength of the evidence for such effects, we meta-analyze
  existing studies that have attempted to estimate interactions between
  preschool and later educational quality in the United States. We then attempt
  to establish the consistency of the direction and a plausible range of
  estimates of the interaction between preschool attendance and subsequent
  educational quality by using a specification curve analysis in a large,
  nationally representative dataset that has been used in several recent studies
  of the sustaining environments hypothesis. The meta-analysis yields small
  positive interaction estimates ranging from approximately 0.00 to 0.04,
  depending on the specification. The specification curve analyses yield
  interaction estimates of approximately 0. Results suggest that the current mix
  of methods used to test the sustaining environments hypothesis cannot reliably
  detect realistically sized effects. Our recommendations are to combine large
  sample sizes with strong causal identification strategies, and to study
  combinations of interventions that have a strong probability of showing large
  main effects. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {In 2001, Anderson and Green [2001. Suppressing unwanted memories
  by executive control. Nature, 410(6826), 366-369] showed memory suppression
  using a novel Think/No-think (TNT) task. When participants attempted to
  prevent studied words from entering awareness, they reported fewer of those
  words than baseline words in subsequent cued recall (i.e., suppression
  effect). The TNT literature contains predominantly positive findings and few
  null-results. Therefore we report unpublished replications conducted in the
  2000s (N = 49; N = 36). As the features of the data obtained with the TNT task
  call for a variety of plausible solutions, we report parallel "universes" of
  data-analyses (i.e., multiverse analysis) testing the suppression effect. Two
  published studies (Wessel et al., 2005. Dissociation and memory suppression: A
  comparison of high and low dissociative individuals' performance on the
  Think-No think Task. Personality and Individual Differences, 39(8), 1461-1470,

  reanalysed in a similar fashion. For recall probed with studied cues (Same
  Probes, SP), some tests (sample 3) or all (samples 2 and 4) showed
  statistically significant suppression effects, whereas in sample 1, only one
  test showed significance. Recall probed with novel cues (Independent Probes,
  IP) predominantly rendered non-significant results. The absence of
  statistically significant IP suppression effects raises problems for
  inhibition theory and its implication that repression is a viable mechanism of
  forgetting. The pre-registration, materials, data, and code are publicly
  available (https://osf.io/qgcy5/).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Throughout the developed world, adolescents are
  growing up with increased access to and engagement with a range of
  screen-based technologies, allowing them to encounter ideas and people on a
  global scale from the intimacy of their bedroom. The concerns about digital
  technologies negatively influencing sleep are therefore especially noteworthy,
  as sleep has been proven to greatly affect both cognitive and emotional
  well-being. The associations between digital engagement and adolescent sleep
  should therefore be carefully investigated in research adhering to the highest
  methodological standards. This understood, studies published to date have not
  often done so and have instead focused mainly on data derived from general
  retrospective self-report questionnaires. The value of this work has been
  called into question by recent research showing that retrospective
  questionnaires might fail to accurately measure these variables of interest.
  Novel and diverse approaches to measurement are therefore necessary for
  academic study to progress. METHODS: This study analyses data from 11,884
  adolescents included in the UK Millennium Cohort Study to examine the
  association between digital engagement and adolescent sleep, comparing the
  relative effects of retrospective self-report vs. time-use diary measures of
  technology use. By doing so, it provides an empirical lens to understand the
  effects of digital engagement both throughout the day and before bedtime and
  adds nuance to a research area primarily relying on retrospective self-report.
  RESULTS: The study finds that there is a small negative association relating
  digital engagement to adolescent sleep both on weekdays and weekend days
  (median standardized association βweekday = -0.06 and βweekend = -0.03). There
  is a more negative association between digital engagement and total sleep time
  on weekdays compared to weekend days (median standardized βweekday = -0.08,
  median standardized βweekend = -0.02), while there is no such difference when
  examining adolescents' bedtime. Surprisingly, and contrary to our
  expectations, digital technology use before bedtime is not substantively
  associated with the amount of sleep and the tardiness of bedtime in
  adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Results derived from the use of transparent
  Specification Curve Analysis methods show that the negative associations in
  evidence are mainly driven by retrospective technology use measures and
  measures of total time spent on digital devices during the day. The effects
  are overall very small: for example, an additional hour of digital screen time
  per day was only related to a 9 min decrease in total time spent sleeping on
  weekdays and a 3 min decrease on weekends. Using digital screens 30 min before
  bed led to a 1 min decrease in total time spent sleeping on weekdays and
  weekends. The study shows that more work should be done examining how to
  measure digital screen time before interventions are designed.},

  bilingualism enhances executive functions. Here, we report a meta-analysis of
  80 studies (253 effect sizes) comparing performance of monolinguals and
  bilinguals on non-verbal interference-control tasks, while examining potential
  moderators of effects on two dependent variables (DVs): global reaction time
  (RT) and interference cost. We used a multiverse approach to determine how
  robust conclusions were to several dataset construction and analysis
  decisions. In our "preferred" analysis, using a broad definition of bilinguals
  and standard versions of interference-control tasks, there was a very small
  but significant bilingual advantage for global RT (g =.13), which became
  non-significant once corrected for publication bias. For interference cost,
  there was a very small but significant bilingual advantage (g =.11). Effects
  were not significantly moderated by task or participant age, but were
  moderated by an interaction between age of second language acquisition (AoA)
  and the DV. Unexpectedly, larger effect sizes for interference cost were
  observed for studies involving bilinguals with late as opposed to early AoA.
  The multiverse analysis produced results largely consistent with the preferred
  analysis, confirming our conclusion that evidence for a bilingual advantage on
  interference-control tasks is weak.},

  abstract = {Which data to analyze, and how, are fundamental questions of all
  empirical research. As there are always numerous flexibilities in
  data-analytic decisions (a "garden of forking paths"), this poses perennial
  problems to all empirical research. Specification-curve analysis and
  multiverse analysis have recently been proposed as solutions to these issues.
  Building on the structural analogies between primary data analysis and
  meta-analysis, we transform and adapt these approaches to the meta-analytic
  level, in tandem with combinatorial meta-analysis. We explain the rationale of
  this idea, suggest descriptive and inferential statistical procedures, as well
  as graphical displays, provide code for meta-analytic practitioners to
  generate and use these, and present a fully worked real example from digit
  ratio (2D:4D) research, totaling 1,592 meta-analytic specifications.
  Specification-curve and multiverse meta-analysis holds promise to resolve
  conflicting meta-analyses, contested evidence, controversial empirical
  literatures, and polarized research, and to mitigate the associated
  detrimental effects of these phenomena on research progress. © 2019 Hogrefe

  families. Arguably, risk-driven discourses are not always evidence-based. This
  is a problem, because blanket assumptions of risk drowns out nuanced empirical
  questions of what constitutes "good" parenting when it comes to smartphone
  use, and for whom. Here we outline three logical missteps which have
  contributed to the deficit zeitgeist-ignoring context, misinterpreting effect,
  and conflation. Further, we speak to questions about parents of young
  children, by refocusing our multiverse analysis on 800+ parents. We ask- where
  are the links between parental phone use and parenting? Are these robust
  versus frail or positive versus negative? After re-examining our 84 analytic
  choices (adopting existing measures), patterns revealed fragility in this
  case. The few findings that did emerge implicated technoference, not
  smartphone use, in relation to negative parenting. We encourage continued
  rigorous and scientific dialogue, to accrue good evidence for families and
  children.},

  independence for many patients post-stroke or brain injury. High dose
  rehabilitation can result in clinically significant improvements in function
  even years after the incident; however, there is still high variability in
  patient responsiveness to such interventions that cannot be explained by age,
  sex, or time since stroke. Methods: This retrospective study investigated
  whether patients prescribed certain classes of central nervous system-acting
  drugs—γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists, antiepileptics, and
  antidepressants—differed in their outcomes on the three-week intensive Queen
  Square Upper-Limb program. For 277 stroke or brain injury patients (167 male,
  median age 52 years (IQR: 21), median time since incident 20 months (IQR: 26))
  upper-limb impairment and activity was assessed at admission to the program
  and at six months post-discharge, using the upper limb component of the
  Fugl-Meyer, Action Research Arm Test, and Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity
  Inventory. Drug prescriptions were obtained from primary care physicians at
  referral. Specification curve analysis was used to protect against selective
  reporting results and add robustness to the conclusions of this retrospective
  study. Results: Patients with GABA agonist prescriptions had significantly
  worse upper-limb scores at admission but no evidence for a significant
  difference in program-induced improvements was found. Additionally, no
  evidence of significant differences in patients with or without antiepileptic
  drug prescriptions on either admission to, or improvement on, the program was
  found in this study. Although no evidence was found for differences in
  admission scores, patients with antidepressant prescriptions experienced
  reduced improvement in upper-limb function, even when accounting for anxiety
  and depression scores. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that, when
  prescribed typically, there was no evidence that patients prescribed GABA
  agonists performed worse on this high-intensity rehabilitation program.
  Patients prescribed antidepressants, however, performed poorer than expected
  on the Queen Square Upper-Limb rehabilitation program. While the reasons for
  these differences are unclear, identifying these patients prior to admission
  may allow for better accommodation of differences in their rehabilitation
  needs. © 2021 World Stroke Organization.},

  investigating brain processes involved in the detection and analysis of
  emotional facial expression are reviewed. In all experiments, emotional faces
  were found to trigger an increased ERP positivity relative to neutral faces.
  The onset of this emotional expression effect was remarkably early, ranging
  from 120 to 180ms post-stimulus in different experiments where faces were
  either presented at fixation or laterally, and with or without non-face
  distractor stimuli. While broadly distributed positive deflections beyond
  250ms post-stimulus have been found in previous studies for non-face stimuli,
  the early frontocentrally distributed phase of this emotional positivity is
  most likely face-specific. Similar emotional expression effects were found for
  six basic emotions, suggesting that these effects are not primarily generated
  within neural structures specialised for the automatic detection of specific
  emotions. Expression effects were eliminated when attention was directed away
  from the location of peripherally presented emotional faces, indicating that
  they are not linked to pre-attentive emotional processing. When foveal faces
  were unattended, expression effects were attenuated, but not completely
  eliminated. It is suggested that these ERP correlates of emotional face
  processing reflect activity within a neocortical system where representations
  of emotional content are generated in a task-dependent fashion for the
  adaptive intentional control of behaviour. Given the early onset of the
  emotion-specific effects reviewed here, it is likely that this system is
  activated in parallel with the ongoing evaluation of emotional content in the
  amygdala and related subcortical brain circuits.},

  because efforts to replicate past study findings frequently do not show the
  same result. Often, the first study showed a statistically significant result
  but the replication does not. Questions then arise about whether the first
  study results were false positives, and whether the replication study
  correctly indicates that there is truly no effect after all. This article
  suggests these so-called failures to replicate may not be failures at all, but
  rather are the result of low statistical power in single replication studies,
  and the result of failure to appreciate the need for multiple replications in
  order to have enough power to identify true effects. We provide examples of
  these power problems and suggest some solutions using Bayesian statistics and
  meta-analysis. Although the need for multiple replication studies may
  frustrate those who would prefer quick answers to psychology's alleged crisis,
  the large sample sizes typically needed to provide firm evidence will almost
  always require concerted efforts from multiple investigators. As a result, it
  remains to be seen how many of the recently claimed failures to replicate will
  be supported or instead may turn out to be artifacts of inadequate sample
  sizes and single study replications.},

  temporary buffer, known as visual short-term memory (VSTM), that sustains
  attended information across saccades and other visual interruptions. There is
  growing debate on whether VSTM capacity is limited to a fixed number of
  objects or whether it is variable. Here we report four experiments using
  functional magnetic resonance imaging that resolve this controversy by
  dissociating the representation capacities of the parietal and occipital
  cortices. Whereas representations in the inferior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS)
  are fixed to about four objects at different spatial locations regardless of
  object complexity, those in the superior IPS and the lateral occipital complex
  are variable, tracking the number of objects held in VSTM, and representing
  fewer than four objects as their complexity increases. These neural response
  patterns were observed during both VSTM encoding and maintenance. Thus,
  multiple systems act together to support VSTM: whereas the inferior IPS
  maintains spatial attention over a fixed number of objects at different
  spatial locations, the superior IPS and the lateral occipital complex encode
  and maintain a variable subset of the attended objects, depending on their
  complexity. VSTM capacity is therefore determined both by a fixed number of
  objects and by object complexity.},

  its current form it comprises four interacting components. Two of these are
  modality-specific memory storage systems, one verbal-acoustic, the
  phonological loop, and one visuospatial, the sketchpad. Information in both
  these stores can be temporarily maintained via focused attention termed
  ‘refreshing’, while the phonological loop can also maintain familiar
  verbalizable material by subvocal or overt rehearsal. Both subsystems are
  controlled by a third component, the central executive, a supervisory system
  with limited resources. The central executive is principally concerned with
  internally directed attentional control processes but also has a role in the
  attentional selection of perceptual information. Information from these three
  components is coordinated with information from perception and long-term
  memory through the fourth component, a multidimensional, multimodal episodic
  buffer. This component is capable of holding up to around four episodic
  chunks, and is a valuable but essentially passive storage system, controlled
  by the central executive and accessible to conscious awareness. The
  multicomponent model has been systematically developed using a number of
  experimental tools. These include, principally, similarity effects to identify
  the type of coding involved, concurrent task methods to assess the
  contributions of the various subsystems to complex tasks, and
  neuropsychological evidence, in particular from the study of single cases with

  or interference? The answer to this question is the topic of an ongoing
  debate. Recently, a number of studies showed that performance in tests of
  visual WM declines with an increasing unfilled retention interval. This
  finding was interpreted as revealing decay. Alternatively, it can be explained
  by interference theories as an effect of temporal distinctiveness. According
  to decay theories, forgetting depends on the absolute time elapsed since the
  event to be retrieved. In contrast, temporal distinctiveness theories predict
  that memory depends on relative time, that is, the time since the
  to-be-retrieved event relative to the time since other, potentially
  interfering events. In the present study, we contrasted the effects of
  absolute time and relative time on forgetting from visual WM, using a
  continuous color recall task. To this end, we varied the retention interval
  and the inter-trial interval. The error in reporting the target color was a
  function of the ratio of the retention interval to the inter-trial interval,
  as predicted by temporal distinctiveness theories. Mixture modeling revealed
  that lower temporal distinctiveness produced a lower probability of reporting
  the target, but no changes in its precision in memory. These data challenge
  the role of decay in accounting for performance in tests of visual WM, and
  show that the relative spacing of events in time determines the degree of
  interference.},

  abstract = {It is usually taken as given that consciousness involves superior
  or more elaborate forms of information processing. Contemporary models equate
  consciousness with global processing, system complexity, or depth or stability
  of computation. This is in stark contrast with the powerful philosophical
  intuition that being conscious is more than just having the ability to
  compute. I argue that it is also incompatible with current empirical findings.
  I present a model that is free from the strong assumption that consciousness
  predicts superior performance. The model is based on Bayesian decision theory,
  of which signal detection theory is a special case. It reflects the fact that
  the capacity for perceptual decisions is fundamentally limited by the presence
  and amount of noise in the system. To optimize performance, one therefore
  needs to set decision criteria that are based on the behaviour, i.e. the
  probability distributions, of the internal signals. One important realization
  is that the knowledge of how our internal signals behave statistically has to
  be learned over time. Essentially, we are doing statistics on our own brain.
  This 'higher-order' learning, however, may err, and this impairs our ability
  to set and maintain optimal criteria for perceptual decisions, which I argue
  is central to perception consciousness. I outline three possibilities of how
  conscious perception might be affected by failures of 'higher-order'
  representation. These all imply that one can have a dissociation between
  consciousness and performance. This model readily explains blindsight and
  hallucinations in formal terms, and is beginning to receive direct empirical
  support. I end by discussing some philosophical implications of the model.},

  Variants of this question have preoccupied researchers in a wide range of
  domains, from mainstream experimental psychology (cognition, perception,
  social behavior) to cognitive neuroscience and behavioral economics. A
  pervasive view places a heavy explanatory burden on an intelligent cognitive
  unconscious, with many theories assigning causally effective roles to
  unconscious influences. This article presents a novel framework for evaluating
  these claims and reviews evidence from three major bodies of research in which
  unconscious factors have been studied: multiple-cue judgment, deliberation
  without attention, and decisions under uncertainty. Studies of priming
  (subliminal and primes-to-behavior) and the role of awareness in movement and
  perception (e.g., timing of willed actions, blindsight) are also given brief
  consideration. The review highlights that inadequate procedures for assessing
  awareness, failures to consider artifactual explanations of "landmark"
  results, and a tendency to uncritically accept conclusions that fit with our
  intuitions have all contributed to unconscious influences being ascribed
  inflated and erroneous explanatory power in theories of decision making. The
  review concludes by recommending that future research should focus on tasks in
  which participants' attention is diverted away from the experimenter's
  hypothesis, rather than the highly reflective tasks that are currently often

  Unaware information processing proved to be quite similar to aware processing

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: According to the traditional two-stage model of face
  processing, the face-specific N170 event-related potential (ERP) is linked to
  structural encoding of face stimuli, whereas later ERP components are thought
  to reflect processing of facial affect. This view has recently been challenged
  by reports of N170 modulations by emotional facial expression. This study
  examines the time-course and topography of the influence of emotional
  expression on the N170 response to faces. METHODS: Dense-array ERPs were
  recorded in response to a set (n = 16) of fear and neutral faces. Stimuli were
  normalized on dimensions of shape, size and luminance contrast distribution.
  To minimize task effects related to facial or emotional processing, facial
  stimuli were irrelevant to a primary task of learning associative pairings
  between a subsequently presented visual character and a spoken word. RESULTS:
  N170 to faces showed a strong modulation by emotional facial expression. A
  split half analysis demonstrates that this effect was significant both early
  and late in the experiment and was therefore not associated with only the
  initial exposures of these stimuli, demonstrating a form of robustness against
  habituation. The effect of emotional modulation of the N170 to faces did not
  show significant interaction with the gender of the face stimulus, or
  hemisphere of recording sites. Subtracting the fear versus neutral topography
  provided a topography that itself was highly similar to the face N170.
  CONCLUSION: The face N170 response can be influenced by emotional expressions
  contained within facial stimuli. The topography of this effect is consistent
  with the notion that fear stimuli exaggerates the N170 response itself. This
  finding stands in contrast to previous models suggesting that N170 processes
  linked to structural analysis of faces precede analysis of emotional
  expression, and instead may reflect early top-down modulation from neural
  systems involved in rapid emotional processing.},

  be implemented computationally at the cognitive and neuronal level. Based on
  theoretical considerations, we explore the possibility that filtering ability
  involves not only the suppression of irrelevant, but also the enhancement of
  relevant information ? functions that might be implemented by different brain
  mechanisms; and we review behavioural and electrophysiological data in light
  of the various resulting model versions. We also highlight that filtering is
  better understood as coordinated brain network activity, rather than being the
  function of a single region. Broadcasting of control signals from prefrontal
  cortex appears critical in upholding information in posterior cortical areas
  in the absence of distractors. The very same ability might also support
  selective processing of relevant information in the presence of distractors.
  These ideas provide a novel explanation for the relation between filtering
  ability and VWM capacity and thereby (re-)establish a central role of
  filtering ability in general VWM functioning.},

  associated with spatially specific activity in the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal

  unconscious levels. Understanding the factors that control whether a stimulus
  reaches our awareness, and the fate of those stimuli that remain at an
  unconscious level, are the major challenges of brain science in the new
  millennium. Since its publication in 1984, Visual Masking has established
  itself as a classic text in the field of cognitive psychology. In the years
  since, there have been considerable advances in the cognitive neurosciences,
  and a growth of interest in the topic of consciousness, and the time is ripe
  for a new edition of this text. Where most current approaches to the study of
  visual consciousness adopt a 'steady-state' view, the approach presented in
  this book explores its dynamic properties. This new edition uses the technique
  of visual masking to explore temporal aspects of conscious and unconscious
  processes down to a resolution in the millisecond range. The 'time slices'
  through conscious and unconscious vision revealed by the visual masking
  technique can shed light on both normal and abnormal operations in the brain.
  The main focus of this book is on the microgenesis of visual form and pattern
  perception - microgenesis referring to the processes occurring in the visual
  system from the time of stimulus presentation on the retinae to the time, a
  few hundred milliseconds later, of its registration at conscious or
  unconscious perceptual and behavioural levels. The book takes a highly
  integrative approach by presenting microgenesis within a broad context
  encompassing visuo-temporal phenomena, attention, and consciousness.},

  challenges in modern science. One key step towards understanding consciousness
  is to empirically narrow down neural processes associated with the subjective

  conditions in which consciousness of a particular content is present with
  those in which it is absent, and to determine differences in measures of brain
  activity (the so called "contrastive analysis"). However, this comparison
  appears not to reveal exclusively the NCC, as the NCC proper can be confounded
  with prerequisites for and consequences of conscious processing of the
  particular content. This implies that previous results cannot be unequivocally
  interpreted as reflecting the neural correlates of conscious experience. Here
  we review evidence supporting this conjecture and suggest experimental

  observed when response-relevant signals are consciously perceived, this
  exogenous mode of response inhibition appears to be mediated by corticostriate

  absent from the ERPs elicited by other animate and inanimate nonface stimuli.
  N170 was largest over the posterior temporal scalp and was larger over the
  right than the left hemisphere. N170 was delayed when faces were presented
  upside-down, but its amplitude did not change. When presented in isolation,
  eyes elicited an N170 that was significantly larger than that elicited by
  whole faces, while noses and lips elicited small negative ERPs about 50 msec
  later than N170. Distorted human faces, in which the locations of inner face
  components were altered, elicited an N170 similar in amplitude to that
  elicited by normal faces. However, faces of animals, human hands, cars, and
  items of furniture did not evoke N170. N170 may reflect the operation of a
  neural mechanism tuned to detect (as opposed to identify) human faces, similar
  to the "structural encoder" suggested by Bruce and Young (1986). A similar

  differential sensitivity of N170 to eyes in isolation suggests that N170 may
  reflect the activation of an eye-sensitive region of cortex. The voltage
  distribution of N170 over the scalp is consistent with a neural generator
  located in the occipitotemporal sulcus lateral to the fusiform/inferior

  abstract = {The ERP component N170 is face-sensitive, yet its specificity for
  faces is controversial. We recorded ERPs while subjects viewed upright and
  inverted faces and seven object categories. Peak, topography and segmentation
  analyses were performed. N170 was earlier and larger to faces than to all
  objects. The classic increase in amplitude and latency was found for inverted
  faces on N170 but also on P1. Segmentation analyses revealed an extra map
  found only for faces, reflecting an extra cluster of activity compared to
  objects. While the N1 for objects seems to reflect the return to baseline from
  the P1, the N170 for faces reflects a supplement activity. The
  electrophysiological 'specificity' of faces could lie in the involvement of
  extra generators for face processing compared to objects and the N170 for
  faces seems qualitatively different from the N1 for objects. Object and face
  processing also differed as early as 120 ms.},

  C.D., Downing, P., Pegna, A.J. 2007. Controlling for interstimulus perceptual

  claimed that the larger occipito-temporal N170 response to pictures of faces
  than other categories -- the N170 effect -- is due to a methodological
  artifact in stimulus selection, specifically, a greater interstimulus physical
  variance between pictures of objects than faces in previous ERP studies which,
  when controlled, eliminates this N170 effect. This statement casts doubts on
  the validity of the conclusions reached by a whole tradition of
  electrophysiological experiments published over the past 15 years and
  questions the very interest of using the N170 to probe the time course of face
  processes in the human brain. Here we claim that this physical variance factor
  is ill-defined by Thierry et al. and cannot account for previous observations
  of a smaller N170 amplitude to nonface objects than faces without latency
  increase and component "smearing". Most importantly, this factor was
  controlled in previous studies that reported robust N170 effects. We
  demonstrate that the absence of N170 effect in the study of Thierry et al. is
  due to methodological flaws in the reported experiments, most notably
  measuring the N170 at the wrong electrode sites. Moreover, the authors
  attributed a modulation of N170 amplitude in their study to a differential
  interstimulus physical variance while it probably reflects a biased comparison
  of different quality sets of individual images. Here, by taking Thierry et
  al.'s study as an exemplar case of what should not be done in ERP research of
  visual categorization processes, we provide clarifications on a number of
  methodological and theoretical issues about the N170 and its largest amplitude
  to faces. More generally, we discuss the potential role of differential visual
  homogeneity of object categories as well as low-level visual properties versus
  high-level visual processes in accounting for early face-preferential
  responses and the question of the speed at which visual stimuli are
  categorized as faces. This survey of the literature points to the N170 as a
  critical event in the time course of face processes in the human brain.},

  abstract = {To identify the neural correlates of perceptual awareness,
  researchers often compare the differences in neural activation between
  conditions in which an observer is or is not aware of a stimulus. While
  intuitive, this approach often contains a critical limitation: to link brain
  activity with perceptual awareness, observers traditionally report the
  contents of their perceptual experience. However, relying on observers'
  reports is problematic because it is difficult to know whether the neural
  responses being measured are associated with conscious perception or with
  postperceptual processes involved in the reporting task (e.g., working memory,
  decision-making). To address this issue, we combined a standard visual masking
  paradigm with a recently developed "no-report" paradigm in male/female human
  participants. In the visual masking paradigm, observers saw images of animals
  and objects that were visible or invisible, depending on their proximity to
  masks. Meanwhile, on half of the trials, observers reported the contents of
  their perceptual experience (i.e., report condition), while on the other half
  of trials they refrained from reporting about their experiences (i.e.,
  no-report condition). We used electroencephalography to examine how visibility
  interacts with reporting by measuring the P3b event-related potential, one of
  the proposed canonical "signatures" of conscious processing. Overall, we found
  a robust P3b in the report condition, but no P3b whatsoever in the no-report
  condition. This finding suggests that the P3b itself is not a neural signature
  of conscious processing and highlights the importance of carefully
  distinguishing the neural correlates of perceptual awareness from
  postperceptual processing.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT What are the neural
  signatures that differentiate conscious and unconscious processing in the
  brain? Perhaps the most well established candidate signature is the P3b
  event-related potential, a late slow wave that appears when observers are
  aware of a stimulus, but disappears when a stimulus fails to reach awareness.
  Here, however, we found that the P3b does not track what observers are
  perceiving, but instead tracks what observers are reporting. When observers
  are aware of simple visual stimuli, the P3b is nowhere to be found unless
  observers are reporting the contents of their experience. These results
  challenge the well established notion of the P3b as a neural marker of
  awareness and highlight the need for new approaches to the neuroscience of
  consciousness.},

  studies have operationalized somatosensory awareness as binary stimulus
  detection. Here, we investigated whether ERP components attributed to neuronal
  activity in early somatosensory cortices would parametrically reflect
  subjective ratings of stimulus awareness. EEG (64 channel) was recorded in
  human participants (N = 20), with perithreshold electrical stimulation applied
  to the left median nerve. Participants indicated perceptibility on a
  continuous visual rating scale, and stimulation intensity was readjusted in
  each block to a perithreshold level. The aim of the analysis was to
  investigate which brain areas reflect the subsequent perceptual awareness
  ratings parametrically, and how early such parametric effects occur.
  Parametric ERP effects were found as early as 86 ms after stimulus onset. This
  parametric modulation of ERP amplitude was source localized to secondary
  somatosensory cortex, and attributed to feedforward processing between primary
  and secondary somatosensory cortex by means of dynamic causal modeling (DCM).
  Furthermore, later in the analysis window, the subjective rating of stimuli
  correlated with the amplitude of the N140 component and with a broadly
  distributed P300 component. By DCM modeling, these late effects were explained
  in terms of recurrent processing within the network of somatosensory and
  premotor cortices. Our results indicate that early neural activity in the

  We recorded magnetoencephalographic signals while human subjects attended

  slightly more often than unattended ones, the factorial analysis of

  neural correlates of visual awareness and spatial attention at different
  frequencies in the gamma range (30-150 Hz). Whether attended or not,

  high-frequency gamma-band activity in response to both consciously seen and

  are reflected by the face-specific N170 component, ERPs (event-related brain
  potentials) were recorded in response to different types of face and non-face
  stimuli. The N170 was strongly attenuated for cheek and back views of faces
  relative to front and profile views, demonstrating that it is not merely
  triggered by head detection. Attenuated and delayed N170 components were
  elicited for faces lacking internal features as well as for faces without
  external features, suggesting that it is not exclusively sensitive to salient
  internal features. It is suggested that the N170 is linked to late stages of
  structural encoding, where representations of global face configurations are
  generated in order to be utilised by subsequent face recognition processes.},

  is the use of simulated random numbers to estimate some functional of a
  probability distribution. A problem that does not have a stochastic component
  can sometimes be posed as a problem with a component that can be identified
  with an expectation of some function of a random variable. This is often done
  by means of a PDF decomposition. The problem is then solved by estimating the
  expected value by use of a simulated sample from the distribution of the
  random variable. Monte Carlo methods use random numbers, so to implement a
  Monte Carlo method it is necessary to have a source of random numbers. On the
  computer, we generally settle for pseudorandom numbers, that is, numbers that
  appear to be random but are actually deterministic. Generation of pseudorandom
  numbers is the topic of Chapter 7. Often, our objective is not to simulate
  random sampling directly, but rather to estimate a specific quantity related
  to the distribution of a given sample. In this case, we may want to ensure
  that a chosen sample closely reflects the distribution of the population we
  are simulating. Because of random variation, a truly random sample or a
  pseudorandom sample that simulates a random sample would not necessarily have
  this property. Sometimes, therefore, we generate a quasirandom sample, which
  is a sample constrained to reflect closely the distribution of the population
  we are simulating, rather than to exhibit the variability that would result
  from random sampling. Because in either case we proceed to treat the samples
  as if they were random, we will refer to both pseudorandom numbers and
  quasirandom numbers as “random numbers”, except when we wish to emphasize the
  “pseudo” or “quasi” nature. In this chapter, we discuss various ways random
  numbers are used in statistical inference. Monte Carlo methods are also used
  in many of the techniques described in other chapters.},

  Forty-two participants were required to discriminate facial expressions of the

  hemisphere, and presentation duration affected the grand-mean ERP (N1, P1, and
  N170) and ERO (below 20 Hz and lasted from 100 ms to 250 ms post-stimulus,
  mainly in theta band) brain activity. More importantly, the overall detection
  ability of 42 subjects was significantly correlated with the emotion effect
  (i.e., fearful vs. neutral) on ERP (r = 0.403) and ERO (r = 0.552)
  measurements. A higher d' value was corresponding to a larger size of the
  emotional effect (i.e., fearful--neutral) of N170 amplitude and a larger size
  of the emotional effect of the specific ERO spectral power at the right

  detection ability and the N170 amplitude as well as the ERO spectral power
  below 20 Hz in individuals. The emotional effect size between fearful and

  suggestive of publication bias were examined in 5,014 meta-analyses from
  Cochrane reviews. P values were also assessed in meta-analyses with varying

  theoretical considerations. Moreover, the newly proposed tests can easily be
  extended to the case of more than one covariate. In a simulation study, we
  compare the tests with regard to their actual significance level and we
  consider the log relative risk as the parameter of interest. Our simulation
  study reflects the meta-analysis of the efficacy of a vaccine for the
  prevention of tuberculosis originally discussed in Berkey et al. The
  simulation study shows that the newly proposed tests are superior to the
  commonly used test in holding the nominal significance level.},

  potentials (ERPs) and novelty processing reveals that the orienting response
  engendered by deviant or unexpected events consists of a characteristic ERP
  pattern, comprised sequentially of the mismatch negativity (MMN) and the
  novelty P3 or P3a. A wide variety of evidence suggests that the MMN reflects
  the detection of deviant events, whereas the P3a is associated more with the
  evaluation of those events for subsequent behavioral action. On the scalp, the
  novelty P3a is comprised of at least two aspects, one frontal the other
  posterior, each with different cognitive (and presumably neurologic)
  correlates. Intracranial ERP investigations and studies of patients with
  localized brain lesions (and, to some extent, fMRI data) converge with the
  scalp-recorded data in suggesting a widespread neural network, the different

  the anterior insula and inferior frontal cortex (IFC), often also the anterior
  cingulate cortex (ACC). ERP work has established increased N2 and P3
  amplitudes during NoGo compared to Go conditions in most studies. Previous
  simultaneous EEG-fMRI imaging reported association of the N2/P3 complex with
  activation of areas like the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) and anterior
  insula. In this study we investigated inhibitory control in 23 healthy young
  adults (mean age=24.7, n=17 for EEG during fMRI) using a combined Flanker/NoGo
  task during simultaneous EEG and fMRI recording. Separate fMRI and ERP
  analysis yielded higher activation in the anterior insula, IFG and ACC as well
  as increased N2 and P3 amplitudes during NoGo trials in accordance with the
  literature. Combined analysis modelling sequential N2 and P3 effects through
  joint parametric modulation revealed correlation of higher N2 amplitude with
  deactivation in parts of the default mode network (DMN) and the cingulate
  motor area (CMA) as well as correlation of higher central P3 amplitude with
  activation of the left anterior insula, IFG and posterior cingulate. The
  EEG-fMRI results resolve the localizations of these sequential activations.
  They suggest a general role for allocation of attentional resources and motor
  inhibition for N2 and link memory recollection and internal reflection to P3
  amplitude, in addition to previously described response inhibition as
  reflected by the anterior insula.},

  we present a theoretical framework that elucidates hippocampal contributions
  to scalp P300 based on intracranial and lesion research combined with emerging
  evidence on the role of the hippocampus in rapid statistical learning, memory,
  and novelty processing. The P300 has been divided in two subcomponents: a
  fronto-central P3a related to novelty and distractor processing, and a
  parietal P3b related to target detection. Interest in a role for hippocampus
  in scalp P300 was sparked by P3-like ERPs measured intracranially in human
  hippocampus. Subsequent medial temporal lobe lesion studies show intact scalp
  P3b, indicating that the hippocampus is not critical for P3b. This contrasts
  with the scalp P3a, which was significantly diminished in human patients with
  lesions in the posterior hippocampus. This suggests a differential role for
  hippocampus in P3a and P3b. Our framework purports that the hippocampus plays
  a central role in distractor processing that leads to P3a generation in
  cortical regions. We also propose that the hippocampus is involved at the end
  of the cognitive episode for both P3a and P3b implementing contextual
  updating. P3-like ERPs measured in hippocampus may reflect input signals from
  cortical regions implementing updates based on the outcome of cognitive
  processes underlying scalp P3, enabling a model update of the environment
  facilitated by the hippocampus. Overall, this framework proposes an active
  role for the hippocampus in novelty processing leading up to P3a generation,
  followed by contextual updating of the outcome of both scalp P3a and P3b.},

  replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise,
  they create wide prediction intervals-and a broad range of replication effects
  that are consistent with the original estimates. This may lead to effects that
  replicate successfully, in that replication results are consistent with
  statistical expectations, but do not provide much information about the size

  attributed to non-conscious working memory processes. However, these studies
  have mainly relied on subjective measures of visual experience, and the neural
  processes responsible for non-conscious short-term retention remains unclear.
  Here we used continuous flash suppression to render stimuli non-conscious in a
  delayed match-to-sample task together with fMRI to investigate the neural
  correlates of non-conscious short-term (5-15 s) retention. The participants'
  behavioral performance was at chance level when they reported no visual

  of BOLD signal during the delay phase could classify presence versus absence
  of sample stimuli based on signal patterns in frontal cortex, and its spatial
  position based on signal patterns in occipital cortex. In addition, univariate
  analyses revealed increased BOLD signal change in prefrontal regions during
  memory recognition. Thus, our findings demonstrate short-term maintenance of
  information presented non-consciously, defined by chance performance
  behaviorally. This non-consciously retained information seems to rely on

  abstract = {Visual awareness is hypothesized to be intimately related to
  visual working memory (WM), such that information present in WM is thought to
  have necessarily been represented consciously. Recent work has challenged this
  longstanding view by demonstrating that visual stimuli rated by observers as
  unseen can nevertheless be maintained over a delay period. These experiments
  have been criticized, however, on the basis that subjective awareness ratings
  may contain response bias (e.g., an observer may report no awareness when in
  fact they had partial awareness). We mitigated this issue by investigating WM
  for visual stimuli that were matched for perceptual discrimination capacity
  (d'), yet which varied in subjective confidence ratings (so-called relative
  blindsight). If the degree of initial subjective awareness of a stimulus
  facilitates later maintenance of that information, WM performance should
  improve for stimuli encoded with higher confidence. In contrast, we found that
  WM performance did not benefit from higher visual discrimination confidence.
  This relationship was observed regardless of WM load (1 or 3). Insofar as
  metacognitive ratings (e.g., confidence, visibility) reflect visual awareness,
  these results challenge a strong relationship between conscious perception and
  WM using a paradigm that controls for discrimination accuracy and is less
  subject to response bias (since confidence is manipulated within subjects).
  Methodologically, we replicate prior efforts to induce relative blindsight
  using similar stimulus displays, providing a general framework for isolating
  metacognitive awareness in order to examine the function of consciousness. ©
